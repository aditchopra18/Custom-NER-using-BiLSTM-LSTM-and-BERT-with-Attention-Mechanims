A
common
human
skin
t##umour
is
caused
by
act##ivating
mutations
in
beta-cat##eni##n.
W##NT
signalling
orchestra##tes
a
number
of
developmental
programs.
In
response
to
this
stimulus,
c##yt##op##las##mic
beta-cat##eni##n
(encoded
by
CT##N##N##B##1)
is
stab##ilized,
enabling
downstream
transcription##al
activation
by
members
of
the
L##EF/T##CF
family.
One
of
the
target
genes
for
beta-cat##eni##n/T##CF
en##codes
c-M##Y##C,
explaining
why
con##st##it##utive
activation
of
the
W##NT
pathway
can
lead
to
cancer,
particularly
in
the
co##lon.
Most
co##lon
cancer##s
arise
from
mutations
in
the
gene
encoding
ad##eno##mat##ous
p##oly##po##sis
co##li
(AP##C),
a
protein
required
for
u##bi##qui##tin-mediated
degradation
of
beta-cat##eni##n,
but
a
small
percentage
of
co##lon
and
some
other
cancer##s
harbour
beta-cat##eni##n-stab##ili##zing
mutations.
Recently,
we
discovered
that
trans##genic
mice
expressing
an
activated
beta-cat##eni##n
are
pre##dis##posed
to
developing
skin
t##umour##s
resembling
p##ilo##mat##ric##oma##s.
Given
that
the
skin
of
these
adult
mice
also
exhibits
signs
of
de
no##vo
hair-f##oll##icle
m##or##ph##ogen##esis,
we
wondered
whether
human
p##ilo##mat##ric##oma##s
might
originate
from
hair
matrix
cells
and
whether
they
might
possess
beta-cat##eni##n-stab##ili##zing
mutations.
Here,
we
explore
the
cell
origin
and
a##eti##ology
of
this
common
human
skin
t##umour.
We
found
nuclear
L##EF-1
in
the
dividing
t##umour
cells,
providing
bio##chemical
evidence
that
p##ilo##mat##ric##oma##s
are
derived
from
hair
matrix
cells.
At
least
75%
of
these
t##umour##s
possess
mutations
affecting
the
amino-terminal
segment,
normally
involved
in
p##hos##ph##ory##lation-dependent,
u##bi##qui##tin-mediated
degradation
of
the
protein.
This
percentage
of
CT##N##N##B##1
mutations
is
greater
than
in
all
other
human
t##umour##s
examined
thus
far,
and
directly
imp##lica##tes
beta-cat##eni##n/L##EF
mi##s##re##gu##lation
as
the
major
cause
of
hair
matrix
cell
tumor##ige##nes##is
in
humans..
H##F##E

in
71##1
hem##och##roma##tosis
pro##band##s:
evidence
for
S##65##C
imp##lication
in
mild
form
of
hem##och##roma##tosis.
Here##dit##ary
hem##och##roma##tosis
(H##H)
is
a
common
auto##so##mal
re##cess##ive
genetic
disorder
of
iron
metabolism.
The
H##F##E
candidate
gene
encoding
an
H##LA
class
I-like
protein
involved
in
H##H
was
identified
in
1996.
Two
miss##ense
mutations
have
been
described
C##28##2##Y,
accounting
for
80%
to
90%
of
H##H
chromosome##s,
and
H##6##3##D,
which
is
associated
with
a
mild##er
form
of
the
disease
representing
40%
to
70%
of
non-C##28##2##Y
H##H
chromosome##s.
We
report
here
on
the
analysis
of
C##28##2##Y,
H##6##3##D,
and
the
193##A--
>
T
substitution
leading
to
the
S##65##C
miss##ense
substitution
in
a
large
series
of
pro##band##s
and
controls.
The
results
confirm
that
the
C##28##2##Y
substitution
was
the
main
mutation
involved
in
hem##och##roma##tosis,
accounting
for
85%
of
carrier
chromosome##s,
whereas
the
H##6##3##D
substitution
represented
39%
of
the
H##H
chromosome##s
that
did
not
carry
the
C##28##2##Y
mutation.
In
addition,
our
screening
showed
that
the
S##65##C
substitution
was
significantly
en##rich##ed
in
pro##band##s
with
at
least
one
chromosome
without
an
assigned
mutation.
This
substitution
accounted
for
7.
8%
of
H##H
chromosome##s
that
were
neither
C##28##2##Y
nor
H##6##3##D.
This
en##rich##ment
of
S##65##C
among
H##H
chromosome##s
suggests
that
the
S##65##C
substitution
is
associated
with
the
mild
form
of
hem##och##roma##tosis.
G##er##m##line
BR##CA##1
alterations
in
a
population-based
series
of
o##var##ian
cancer
cases.
The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
provide
more
accurate
frequency
estimates
of
breast
cancer
su##s##ce##pt##ibility
gene

(BR##CA##1)
g##er##m##line
alterations
in
the
o##var##ian
cancer
population.
To
achieve
this,
we
determined
the
prevalence
of
BR##CA##1
alterations
in
a
population-based
series
of
consecutive
o##var##ian
cancer
cases.
This
is
the
first
population-based
o##var##ian
cancer
study
reporting
BR##CA##1
alterations
derived
from
a
comprehensive
screen
of
the
entire
coding
region.
One
hundred
and
seven
o##var##ian
cancer
cases
were
analyzed
for
BR##CA##1
alterations
using
the
R##N##ase
mi##sma##tch
c##lea##vage
ass##ay
followed
by
direct
se##quencing.
Two
t##run##cating
mutations,
96##2##del##4
and
360##0##del##11,
were
identified.
Both
patients
had
a
family
history
of
breast
or
o##var##ian
cancer.
Several
novel
as
well
as
previously
reported
un##cha##rac##ter##ized
variants
were
also
identified,
some
of
which
were
associated
with
a
family
history
of
cancer.
The
frequency
distribution
of
common
p##oly##mor##phism##s
was
determined
in
the
91
Caucasian
cancer
cases
in
this
series
and
24
sister
controls
using
all##ele-specific
am##p##lification.
The
rare
form
of
the
Q##35##6##R
p##oly##mor##phism
was
significantly
(P
=
0.
03)
associated
with
a
family
history
of
o##var##ian
cancer,
suggesting
that
this
p##oly##mor##phism
may
influence
o##var##ian
cancer
risk.
In
summary,
our
data
suggest
a
role
for
some
un##cha##rac##ter##ized
variants
and
rare
forms
of
p##oly##mor##phism##s
in
determining
o##var##ian
cancer
risk,
and
highlight
the
necessity
to
screen
for
miss##ense
alterations
as
well
as
t##run##cating
mutations
in
this
population.

The
ad##eno##mat##ous

(AP##C)
t##umour-suppress##or
protein
controls
the

pathway
by

3##bet##a
(G##S##K-3##bet##a),
a##xin/conduct##in
and
beta##cate##nin.
Complex
formation
induce##s
the
rapid
degradation
of
beta##cate##nin.
In
co##lon
car##cin##oma
cells,
loss
of
AP##C
leads
to
the
accumulation
of
beta##cate##nin
in
the
nucleus,
where
it
binds
to
and
activate##s
the
T##c##f-4
transcription
factor
(reviewed
in
[1]
[2]).
Here,
we
report
the

of
AP##C
ho##mo##logue##s.
Ma##mmal##ian
AP##C##2,
which
closely
resembles
AP##C
in
overall
domain
structure,
was
functional##ly
analyzed
and
shown
to
contain
two
SA##MP
domains,
both
of
which
are
required
for
binding
to
conduct##in.
Like
AP##C,
AP##C##2
regulate##s
the
formation
of
active

as
demonstrated
using
trans##ient

ass##ays
in
AP##C

cells.
Human
AP##C##2
maps
to

AP##C
and
AP##C##2
may
therefore
have
comparable
functions
in
development
and
cancer.

The

of
a
29-year
old

with
a
recent

infection
and
a

men##ing##itis
and
art##hr##itis
as
a

was
found
to
lack
serum
hem##oly##tic
complement

The
seventh
component
of
complement
(C##7)
was
not
detected
by
functional
or
im##mu##no##chemical
ass##ays,
whereas
other
components
were
normal
by
hem##oly##tic

im##mu##no##chemical
assessment.
Her
fresh
serum
lacked
complement-mediated
b##act##eric##idal
activity
against
N##ei##sser##ia
go##nor##r##hoe##ae,
but
the
addition
of
fresh
normal
serum
or
pu##rified
C##7
restored
b##act##eric##idal
activity
as
well
as
hem##oly##tic
activity.
The
absence
of
functional
C##7
activity
could
not
be
accounted
for
on
the
basis
of
an
inhibitor.
Op##son##ization
and
generation
of
ch##em##ota##ctic

functioned
normally.
Complete
absence
of
C##7
was
also
found
in
one
sibling
who
had
the
clinical
syndrome
of
men##ing##oc##oc##cal
men##ing##itis

represents
the

Using

we

33%
but
does
not

Therefore,
H##F##E
appears
to
reduce

within

H##F##E
specifically

as
non-T##f-mediated

in
the

Jewish
population.
F##ami##lial
Mediterranean
fever
(FM##F)
is
a
re##cess##ive
disorder
characterized
by
episodes
of
fever
with
se##ros##itis
or
s##yn##ov##itis.
The
FM##F
gene
(ME##F##V)
was
clone##d
recently,
and
four
miss##ense
mutations
were
identified.
Here
we
present
data
from
non-Ash##ken##azi
Jewish
and
Arab
patients
in
whom
we
had
not
originally
found
mutations
and
from
a
new,
more
ethnic##ally
diverse
panel.
Among
90
s##ym##pt##oma##tic
mutation-positive
individuals,
11
mutations
accounted
for
79%
of
carrier
chromosome##s.
Of
the
two
mutations
that
are
novel,
one
alter##s
the
same
residue
(680)
as
a
previously
known
mutation,
and
the
other
(P##36##9##S)
is
located
in
ex##on
3.
Con##sist##ent
with
another
recent
report,
the
E##14##8##Q
mutation
was
observed
in
patients
of
several
ethnic##ities
and
on
multiple
micro##sat##elli##te
ha##p##lot##ype##s,
but
ha##p##lot##ype
data
indicate
an
ancestral
relationships
between
non-Jewish
Italian
and
Ash##ken##azi
Jewish
patients
with
FM##F
and
other
affected
populations.
Among
approximately
200
anonymous
Ash##ken##azi
Jewish
DNA
samples,
the
ME##F##V
carrier
frequency
was
21%,
with
E##14##8##Q
the
most
common
mutation.
Several
lines
of
evidence
indicate
reduced
pen##et##rance
among
Ash##ken##azi
Jews,
especially
for
E##14##8##Q,
P##36##9##S,
and
K##6##9##5##R.
Nevertheless,
E##14##8##Q
helps
account
for
re##cess##ive
inheritance
in
an
Ash##ken##azi
family
previously
reported
as
an
unusual
case
of
dominant##ly
inherited

The
presence
of
three

(AL##PS)
is
a

Most

have
a

Of
17
unique

mutations
in
unrelated

pro##band##s,
12
(71%)
occurred
in

which
en##code
the

Similar

the

The

Two

occurs
in
over
90%
of

To
determine
the
molecular

of
type

the

were
characterized
from
a

We
found
a

beginning
9

this

These

demonstrate
that
1)

is
a

The

the

to
be
involved
in

mice
exhibit
a
p##hen##otype
with
some
similarities
to
humans,
such
as
mac##roo##rch##id##ism
and
behavioral
abnormal##ities.
As
a
step
toward
understanding
the
function
of
FM##R##1
and
the
determination
of
the
potential
for
therapeutic
approaches
to
fragile

yeast
artificial

trans##genic
mice
were
generated
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
F##m##r##1
knockout
mouse
p##hen##otype
could
be
rescued.
Several
trans##genic
lines
were
generated
that
carried
the
entire
FM##R##1
lo##cus
with
extensive
amounts
of
flank##ing
sequence.
We
observed
that
the
Y##AC
trans##gene
supported
production
of
the
human
protein
(FM##RP)
which
was
present
at
levels
10
to
15
times
that
of
end##ogen##ous
protein
and
was
expressed
in
a
cell-
and
tissue-specific
manner.
Mac##ro-orchid##ism
was
absent
in
knockout
mice
carrying
the
Y##AC
trans##gene
indicating
functional
rescue
by
the
human
protein.
Given
the
complex
behavioral
p##hen##otype
in
fragile
X
patients
and
the
mild
p##hen##otype
previously
reported
for
the
F##m##r##1
knockout
mouse,
we
performed
a
more
thorough
evaluation
of
the
F##m##r##1
knockout
p##hen##otype
using
additional
behavioral
ass##ays
that
had
not
previously
been
reported
for
this
animal
model.
The
mouse
displayed
reduced
anxiety-related
responses
with
increased
ex##p##lora##tory
behavior.
FM##R##1
Y##AC
trans##genic
mice
over##ex##pressing
the
human
protein
did
produce
opposing
behavioral
responses
and
additional
abnormal
behaviors
were
also
observed.
These
findings
have
significant
implications
for
gene
therapy
for
fragile

While

is
diagnostic
in

en##zy##matic
detection
of

By

we
have
characterized
the
mutations
underlying

in
16
individuals
from
six
unrelated
families
with
F##D.
The

included
five

(C##20##2##W,
C##22##3##G,
N##22##4##D,

and
one
s##p##lice-site

Studies
at

showed
that

led
to

By

Evidence
for

A

on
chromosome
18
and
a
parent-of-origin
effect
have
been
suggested
for
bi##pol##ar
affect##ive

(BP##AD).
We
have
studied
28
nuclear

selected
for
apparent
un##ili##nea##l
transmission
of
the
BP##AD
p##hen##otype,
by
using
31
p##oly##morphic
markers
spanning

Evidence
for
link##age
was
tested
with
affected-si##b-pair
and
L##OD
score
methods
under
two
definitions
of
the
affected
p##hen##otype.
The
affected-si##b##pair
analyses
indicated
excess
all##ele
sharing
for
markers
on
18##p
within
the
region
reported
previously.
The
greatest

was
at

64%
in
bi##pol##ar
and
re##current
un##ip##olar

(P

In
addition,
excess
sharing
of
the
paternal##ly,
but
not
maternal##ly,
transmitted
all##ele##s
was
observed
at
three
markers
on
18##q
at
D##18##S##41,
51
bi##pol##ar
and
R##UP
si##b

were
con##cor##dant
for
paternal##ly
transmitted
all##ele##s,
and
21
pairs
were
disco##rda##nt
(P
=
000##4).
The
evidence
for
link##age
to
lo##ci
on
both
18##p
and
18##q
was
strongest
in
the
11
paternal
p##ed##ig##ree##s,
i.
e
e.,
those
in
which
the
father
or
one

is
affected.
In
these
p##ed##ig##ree##s,
the
greatest

and
the
highest

(3.

were
observed
at
D##18##S##41.
Our
results
provide
further
support
for

18
and
the
first
molecular
evidence
for
a

operating
in

were
found
among
the

protein,
re##tino##sch##isi##n,
which
contains

but
is
of

function.
We
have
generated
a
p##oly##c##lon##al
anti##body
against
a
p##eptide
from
a
unique
region
within
re##tino##sch##isi##n,
which
detect##s
a

samples
reduced
with
di##thi##oth##re##ito##l,
but

40
k##D##a
under

conditions.
A
screen
of
human
tissues
with
this
anti##body
reveals
re##tino##sch##isi##n
to
be
re##tina

and
the
anti##body
detect##s
a
protein
of
similar
size
in
b##ov##ine
and
m##uri##ne

We
investigated
the

in
the
re##tina
of
both

(using
in
sit##u

with
rib##op##robe##s)
and
re##tino##sch##isi##n
(using
im##mu##no##his##to##chemistry).
The
anti##sen##se
rib##op##robe
detected
RS##1
m##RNA
only
in
the
photo##re##ceptor
layer
but
the
protein
product
of
the

was
present
both
in
the
photo##re##ceptor##s
and
within
the
inner
portions
of
the

Furthermore,
differentiated
re##tino##blast##oma
cells
(We##ri-R##b##1
cells)
were
found
to
express
RS##1
m##RNA
and
to
release
re##tino##sch##isi##n.
These
results
suggest
that
re##tino##sch##isi##n
is
released
by
photo-receptors
and
has
functions
within
the
inner
re##tina##l
layers.
Thus,
X-linked

is
caused
by

gene.
The
o##cu##loc##ere##bro##rena##l
syndrome
of
Lowe
(O##CR##L)
is
an
X-linked
disorder
characterized
by
major
abnormal##ities
of
eyes,
nervous
system,
and
kidney##s.
Mu##tations
in
the
O##CR##L##1
gene
have
been
associated
with
the
disease.

5-p##hos##pha##tase.
We
have
examined
the
O##CR##L##1
gene
in
eight
unrelated
patients
with
O##CR##L
and
have
found
seven
new
mutations
and
one
re##current
in-frame
del##eti##on.
Among
the
new
mutations,
two
nonsense
mutations
(R##31##7##X
and
E##55##8##X)
and
three
other
frames##hi##ft
mutations
caused
premature
termination
of
the
protein.
A
miss##ense
mutation,
R##48##3##G,
was
located
in
the
highly
conserved
P##t##d##I##ns
(4,
5)
P##2
5-p##hos##pha##tase
domain.
Finally,
one
frames##hi##ft
mutation,
27##9##9##del##C,
m##od##ifies
the
C-terminal
part
of
O##CR##L##1,
with
an
extension
of
six
amino
acids.
Alto##get##her,
70%
of
miss##ense
mutations
are
located
in
ex##on
15,
and
52%
of
all
mutations
cluster
in
ex##ons
11-15.
We
also
identified
two
new
micro##sat##elli##te
markers
for
the
O##CR##L##1
lo##cus,
and
we
detected
a
g##er##m##line

in
one
family.
This
observation
has
direct
implications
for

Du##chen##ne
muscular
d##ys##tro##phy
(D##MD)
is
caused
by
mutations
in
the
d##ys##tro##phi##n
gene,
leading
to
the
absence
of
the
d##ys##tro##phi##n
protein
in
s##tri##ated
muscle.
A
significant
number
of
these
mutations
are
premature

co##don##s.
On
the
basis
of
the
observation
that
amino##gly##cos##ide
treatment
can
suppress
stop
co##don##s
in
culture##d
cells,
we
tested
the
effect
of
g##ent##ami##cin
on

cells
from
the
m##d##x
mouse
-
an
animal
model
for
D##MD
that
possesses
a
premature
stop
co##don
in
the
d##ys##tro##phi##n
gene.
Expo##sure
of
m##d##x
my##ot##ube##s
to
g##ent##ami##cin
led
to
the
expression
and
local##ization
of
d##ys##tro##phi##n
to
the
cell
membrane.
We
then
evaluated
the
effects
of
differing
dos##ages
of
g##ent##ami##cin
on
expression
and
functional
protection
of
the
muscles
of
m##d##x
mice.
We
identified
a
treatment
regime##n
that
resulted
in
the
presence
of
d##ys##tro##phi##n
in
the
cell
membrane
in
all
s##tri##ated
muscles
examined
and
that
provided
functional
protection
against
muscular
injury.
To
our
knowledge,
our
results
are
the
first
to
demonstrate
that
amino##gly##cos##ides
can
suppress
stop
co##don##s
not
only
in
v##it##ro
but
also
in
v##ivo.
Furthermore,
these
results
raise
the
possibility
of
a
novel
treatment
regime##n
for
muscular
d##ys##tro##phy
and
other
diseases
caused
by
premature

For

formed

confirming
that

These

show
that

can
be

BR##CA##1

Nine
of
these

have
not
been

The

have
been
described.
We
analyzed
the
H##EX##A

of
one

and
identified
both
a
C##7##39-to-T

that

on

and
a
previously

on
the

Six
additional
pseudo##de##ficient

were
found
to
have
the

mutation.
This

accounted
for
32%
(20/62)
of
non-Jewish

but
for
none
of
36
Jewish

The

A

the
mutation
(s)
responsible
for
Ta##y-Sachs
disease
(T##SD)
in
a
C##aj##un
population
in
southwest
Louisiana
and
to
identify
the
origins
of
these
mutations.
Eleven
of
12

had

mutation
that
is
present
in
approximately
70%
of

in
the
remaining
all##ele
was
a
single-base
transition
in
the

of
the

To
determine
the
origins
of
these
two

in
the
C##aj##un
population,
the
T##SD
carrier

was
en##zy##matical##ly
determined
for
90
members
of
four
of
the
six

and
extensive

were
constructed
for

from

was
found
to
be
common
to
most
of
the

of
the

P##ed##ig##ree
data
suggest
that
this
mutation
has
been
in
the
C##aj##un
population
since
its
founding
over
2
centuries
ago
and
that
it
may
be
widely
distributed
within
the
population.
In

the

apparently
was
introduced
within
the

On
the
basis
of
a
sperm
typing
study
performed
in
patients
of
Japanese
descent
with
Mac##had##o-Joseph
disease
(M##J##D),
it
was
reported
that
disease
all##ele##s
are
prefer##ential##ly
transmitted
during
me##ios##is.
We
performed
a
sperm
typing
study
of
five
M##J##D
patients
of
French
descent
and
analysis
of
the
pool##ed
data
shows
a
ratio
of
mutant
to
normal
all##ele##s
of
37##9
43##6
(46.

5%),
which
does
not
support

To
confirm
these
results,
sperm
typing
analysis
was
also
performed
using
a
p##oly##morphic
marker,
D##14##S##10##50,
closely
linked
to
the
M##J##D##1
gene.
Among
91##0
sperm
analyzed,
the

linked
to
the
disease
chromosome
was
detected
in

3%
of
the
samples
and
the
all##ele
linked
to
the
normal
chromosome
was
found
in

of
the

The
difference
in
frequency
of
these

Like##lihood-based
analysis
of
segregation

in
the

using
the
SP##ER##MS##EG
program
also
showed
no
support
for
segregation
distortion
at
the
game##te
level
in
this
patient
population.
The
previous
report
on
the
Japanese
patients
also
suggested
that
disease
all##ele
stability
may
be
influenced
by
a
trans

The

p##oly##po##sis,
is
m##uta##ted
in
human
gas##tric
cancer.
Although
gas##tric
cancer
is
the
most
common
cancer
in
the
world,
genetic
changes
during
its
car##cin##ogen##esis
are
not
well
understood.
Since
some
gas##tric
cancer##s
are
considered
to
originate
from
the
in##test##inal
meta##p##lasia,
it
is
likely
that
the
ad##eno##mat##ous

co##li
(AP##C)
gene,
the
mutation
of
which
causes
ad##eno##mat##ous
p##oly##ps
in
the
co##lon,
is
associated
with
car##cin##ogen##esis
of
gas##tric
cancer.
Based
on
this
idea,
DNA##s
isolated
from
gas##tric
cancer##s
were
examined
by
means
of
a
R##N##ase
protection
analysis
coupled
with
polymer##ase
chain
reaction
followed
by
se##quencing
of
the

products.
By
screening
nearly
one-half
of
the
coding
region
of
the
AP##C
gene

44
tumors,
so##matic

were
detected
in

and
a

del##eti##on
resulting
in
a
frame
shift
which
causes

of
the

These
results
suggest
that
the
mutation
of
the
AP##C
gene
also
plays
an
important
role
during
the
car##cin##ogen##esis
of
at

in
a

we
collected

Cy##to##gene##tic
and
carrier
studies
revealed
structural##ly
normal
chromosome##s
for
this
patient
and
her
parents
and
demonstrated
that
this

arose
through
a
de

game##tic
event.
Co##mp##aris##on
of

DNA
with
the
DNA
of
her

revealed
that
a
micro##del##eti##on,
which
occurred
within
a
maternal
game##te
and
involved
the
entire
HP##RT
gene,
was
partially
responsible
for
the
disease
in
this
patient.
So##matic
cell
hybrid##s,
generated
to
separate

p##hos##ph##og##ly##cer##ate
kinase
and
glucose-6-phosphate
de##hy##dr##ogen##ase,
were
expressed
only
in
cells
that
contained
the
maternal
X
chromosome,
suggesting
the
presence
of
a
functional##ly
inactive
paternal
X
chromosome.
Furthermore,
comparison
of
met##hyl##ation
patterns
within
a
region
of
the
HP##RT
gene
known
to
be
important

revealed

in
keeping
with
an
active
HP##RT
lo##cus
in
the
father
and
an

Together
these

indicate
that

and
a

The

has
been
mapped
to

which
has
been
localized
to
the

Mu##tations
spanning
the

have
been
identified
in

We
present
here
the
effect,
on
em##eri##n
protein
expression,
of
two
miss##ense
mutations
identified
in
unrelated
E##DM##D
patients.
These
alterations
predict
the
replacement
of
a
pro##line
residue
at
position
183
with
either
a
his##ti##dine
or
a

B##io##chemical

has
demonstrated
that
the

levels
of
the
mutant
forms
of
em##eri##n
are
in##dis##ting##ui##sha##ble
from
that
of
wild-type
em##eri##n,
but
that
they
have
weakened

components.
In
comparison
with
the
usual
E##DM##D
p##hen##otype,
patients
with
P##18##3
miss##ense
mutations
have
a
later
age
at

of
first

elbow

weakness,
but
there
is
no
difference
for
the

This
is
the
first
report
of
protein
studies
on
patients
with
miss##ense
mutations
resulting
in
the
clinical
features
of
E##DM##D.
These

gene,
BR##CA##1,
in
cases
of
non-hereditary

but
had
no

may
normally
serve
as
a

(P##LP)
is
normally
present
at
chromosome
X##q##22.
Mu##tations
and
du##plication##s
of
this

are
associated
with
P##eli##za##eus-Me##rz##bach##er

(PM##D).
Here
we
describe
two

of
P##LP
on
the

to
a

In
the

family,
the
extra

was
first
detected
by
the
presence
of
he##tero##zy##gos##ity
of
the
Ah##a##II

within
the

although
no

could
be
detected
by

Another
three
affected
males
from
the
family
had
similar
findings.
In
a
second
unrelated
family
with
signs
of
PM##D,
c##yt##ogen##etic

showed
a
per##ice##nt##ric

of
the

In

A

of
the
P##LP
gene
detected
at

in
a

The
identification
of
three

in
which
P##LP
is
du##plicate##d
at

suggests
that
such

From

C##YP##2##A
appears
to

Consequently,
both

1)
the

F##ami##lial
Mediterranean
fever
(FM##F)
is
a
re##cess##ive
disorder
characterized
by
episodes
of
fever
with
se##ros##itis
or
s##yn##ov##itis.
Recently
the
FM##F
gene
(ME##F##V)
was
clone##d;
the
protein
product,
p##yr##in/mare##nos##tri##n,
is
thought
to
regulate
inflammation
in
my##elo##id
cells.
In
this
manuscript
we
report
the
mouse
and
rat
ho##mo##log##s
of
ME##F##V.
The
m##uri##ne
gene
contains
ten
ex##ons
with
a
coding
sequence
of
230##4
b##p,
while
the
rat
ho##mo##log
has
nine
ex##ons
with
a
coding
sequence
of
225##3
b##p.
A
considerable
amino

sequence
ho##mology
was
observed
between
the
mouse
and
human
(47.
6%
identity
and
65.
5%
similarity)
and
between
the
mouse
and
rat
genes
(73.
5%
identity
and
82.
1%
similarity).
The
predicted
rode##nt
proteins
have
several
important
domains
and
signals
found
in
human
p##yr##in,
including
a
B-box
zinc
finger
domain,
Robbins-Din##g##wall
nuclear
local##ization
signal,
and
coil##ed-coil
domain.
However,
perhaps
because
of
an
ancient
frame-shift
mutation,
neither
the
mouse
nor
the
rat
protein
has
an
intact
C-terminal
B##30.

domain,
in
which
most
FM##F-associated
mutations
have
been
found
in
human
ME##F##V.
Nevertheless,
like
the
human
gene,
mouse
Me##f##v
is
expressed
in
peripheral
blood
g##ran##ulo##cy##tes
but
not
l##ymph##ocytes.
Con##sist##ent
with
its
expression
in
g##ran##ulo##cy##tes,
Me##f##v
was
detected
at
high
levels
in
the
primary
f##oll##icles
and
marginal
zones
of
the
s##ple##nic
white

Me##f##v
is

We

belonging
to
a

p##oly##mor##phism
(RF##LP)
analysis
with
probe
M##27
beta,
closely
linked
to
the
WA##S
gene,
demonstrated
that
she
is
a
carrier
of
WA##S.
Both
small-sized
and
normal-sized
plate##lets
were
present,
suggesting
that,
unlike
the
vast
majority
of
WA##S
carriers,
she
does
not
manifest
non##rand##om
X-chromosome
in##act##ivation
in
the
th##rom##bo##po##iet##ic
cell
lineage.
Study
of
X-chromosome
in##act##ivation
by
means
of
RF##LP
and
met##hyl##ation
analysis
demonstrated
that
the
pattern
of
X-chromosome
in##act##ivation
was
non##rand##om
in
T
l##ymph##ocytes,
but
random
in
g##ran##ulo##cy##tes.
While
this
is
the

on
the

of
th##rom##bo##cy##top##enia
in
a

female
of
WA##S
as
the
result
of

it
also
suggests
that

occurs
at

a

Mu##tations

gene
are
found
in
almost
all
of
the
families
with
inherited
breast
and
o##var##ian
cancer##s
and
about
half
of
the
families
with
only
breast
cancer.
Although
the
bio##chemical
function
of
BR##CA##1
is
not
well
understood,
it
is
important
for
DNA
damage
repair
and
cell-cycle
check##point.
BR##CA##1
exists
in
nuclear
f##oc##i
but
is
h##yper##ph##os##ph##ory##lated
and
di##sper##ses
after
DNA
damage.
It
is
not
known
whether
BR##CA##1
p##hos##ph##ory##lation
and
di##sper##sion
and
its
function
in
DNA
damage
response
are
related.
In
yeast
the
DNA
damage
response
and
the
replication-block
check##point
are
mediated
partly
through
the
C##ds##1
kinase
family.
Here
we
report
that
the
human
C##ds##1
kinase
(h##C##ds##1/Ch##k##2)
regulate##s
BR##CA##1
function
after
DNA
damage
by
p##hos##ph##ory##lating
se##rine
98##8
of
BR##CA##1.
We
show
that
h##C##ds##1
and
BR##CA##1
interact
and
co-local##ize
within
discrete
nuclear
f##oc##i
but
separate
after
gamma
i##rra##diation.
Ph##os##ph##ory##lation
of
BR##CA##1
at
se##rine
98##8
is
required
for
the
release
of
BR##CA##1
from
h##C##ds##1.
This
p##hos##ph##ory##lation
is
also
important
for
the

of

to
restore

Spin##oc##ere##bella##r
at##ax##ia
type-3
or
Mac##had##o-Joseph
disease
(SC##A##3/M##J##D)
is
a
member
of
the
CA##G/p##oly##g##lut##amine
repeat
disease
family.
In
this
family
of
disorders,
a
normally
p##oly##morphic
CA##G
repeat
becomes
expanded,
resulting
in
expression
of
an
expanded
p##oly##g##lut##amine
domain
in
the
disease
gene
product.
Experimental
models
of
p##oly##g##lut##amine
disease
imp##lica##te
the
nucleus
in
path##ogen##esis;
however,
the
link
between
in##tra##nu##cle##ar
expression
of
expanded
p##oly##g##lut##amine
and
ne##uron##al
d##ys##function
remains
unclear.
Here
we
demonstrate
that
at##ax##in-3,
the
disease
protein
in
SC##A##3/M##J##D,
adopt##s
a
unique
conform##ation
when
expressed
within
the
nucleus
of
trans##fected
cells.
The
mon##oc##lon##al
anti##body
1##C##2
is
known
prefer##ential##ly
to
bind
expanded
p##oly##g##lut##amine,
but
we
find
that
it
also
binds
a
fragment
of
at##ax##in-3
containing
a
normal
g##lut##amine
repeat.
In
addition,
expression
of
at##ax##in-3
within
the
nucleus
expose##s
the
g##lut##amine
domain
of
the
full-length
non-path##ological
protein,
allowing
it
to
bind
the
mon##oc##lon##al
anti##body
1##C##2.
Fr##action##ation
and
im##mu##no##chemical
experiments
indicate
that
this
novel
conform##ation
of
in##tra##nu##cle##ar
at##ax##in-3
is
not
due
to
pro##te##oly##sis,
suggesting
instead
that
association
with
nuclear
protein
(s)
alter##s
the
structure
of
full-length
at##ax##in-3
which
expose##s
the
p##oly##g##lut##amine
domain.
This
conform##ational##ly
altered
at##ax##in-3
is
bound
to
the
nuclear
matrix.
The
path##ological
form
of
at##ax##in-3
with
an
expanded
p##oly##g##lut##amine
domain
also
associates
with
the
nuclear
matrix.
These
data
suggest
that
an
early
event
in
the
path##ogen##esis
of
SC##A##3/M##J##D
may
be
an
altered
conform##ation
of
at##ax##in-3
within
the

that
expose##s
the
p##oly##g##lut##amine
domain..

The

can
provide
valuable

most
important
findings
can
be
summarized
as
follows
(1)
The
Spanish
population
is
characterized
by
an
important
he##tero##gene##ity
in
G##6##PD
deficiency.
(2)
Although
G##6##PD
Mediterranean
is
very
frequent,
it
presents
a
relatively
high
degree
of
p##oly##mor##phism.
(3)
F##avi##sm
has
been
observed
associated
with
all
kinds
of
variants
described
here.
(4)
G##6##PD
Bet##ica,
which
is
the
most
frequent
variant
found
in
subjects
of
Southern
Spanish
origin,
has
been
observed
associated
with
f##avi##sm
in
all
cases
except
one.

in
a

A
boy
developed
contract##ures
of
the
Achilles
tend##ons
at
3
years
and
of
the
post##cer##vic##al
muscles
at
7
years,
although
neither
contract##ures
of
the
elbows
nor
cardiac
abnormal##ity
were
recognized
by
the
age
of
9
years.
Mu##s##cle
com##puted

scanning
revealed
changes
characteristic
of
muscle
involvement.
Em##eri##n
was
not
detected
in
the
bio##ps##ied
muscle,
and
R##T-PC##R
and
PC##R-based
g##eno##mic
DNA
analyses
of
the
em##eri##n
gene
demonstrated
no
am##p##lification

in
the
patient.
These
results
confirmed
the
diagnosis
of
X-linked
Emery-Dr##ei##fu##ss
muscular
d##ys##tro##phy
(E##DM##D),
and
reinforce
the
necessity
of
molecular
genetic
diagnosis
of
the
membrane
protein

in
younger
patients
with
possible
E##DM##D
before
appearance
of
the
typical

Rear##rang##ement
of
the

appears
to
be

l##ymph##oma
and
also
is
found

Rear##rang##ement
is
thought
to

but
trans##cribed

PR##AD##1,
previously

this
highly

has
been

also
in

Its

may
be
a
key
consequence
of
rear##rang##ement
of
the

from
male

for
their
ability
to
support
growth
in
v##it##ro
of
the
malaria-causing
organism
P##las##mo##dium

Para##site

was
approximately
one-third
of

in
both

for
G##6##PD

In

trait,
parasite
growth
was
normal
except
when
G##6##PD
deficiency
occurred
together
with
the
th##ala##sse##mia
trait.
The
data
support
the
hypothesis
that
G##6##PD
deficiency
may
con##fer
a
selective
advantage
in
a
ma##lar##ious
area;
the
female
he##tero##zy##got##e
may
be
at
a
particular
advantage
because
resistance
to
malaria
equals
that
of
male
hem##iz##y##got##es,
but
the
risk
of
fatal
hem##oly##sis
may
be
less.
However,
more
female
he##tero##zy##got##es
must
be
studied
to
confirm
this
hypothesis.

The

controversial,
though
the

g##lo##mer##ulon##ep##hr##itis.
A
10-year-old
Lao##tian

had
ho##mo##zy##go##us
deficiency
of
the
third
component
of
complement
and
re##current
bacterial

beginning
at

were
def##icient.

although
significant

were
not
detected.
These
findings
further
support
the
association
of
C##3

with
immune-complex

and
suggest
that

be
an

BR##CA##1
en##codes
a
tumor
suppress##or
that
is
m##uta##ted
in
f##ami##lial
breast

o##var##ian
cancer##s.
Here,
it
is
shown
that
BR##CA##1
interact##s
in
v##it##ro
and
in
v##ivo
with
h##R##ad##50,
which
forms
a
complex
with

Upon

BR##CA##1
in

These

suggest
that
BR##CA##1
is
important
for

that
are
mediated
by
the

show
the
normal

of
t##iti##n

ne##bul##in
p##oly##pe##pt##ides.
Since
the

of
one
of
these
bio##ps##ies
has
a
large
del##eti##on
of
the
5-region
of
the
D##MD

our
results
argue
against
the
recent
proposal
that
ne##bul##in
is
the

The

is
correlated
to
the
extent
of
expansion
of
an

Recent

have
demonstrated
that
this

I##mm##uno##his##to##chemical

at

(N##M##J##s

These
and
other

contribute
to

cancer-su##s##ce##pt##ibility.
Approximately
0.
5%
-1%
of
the
general
population
has
been
estimated
to
be
he##tero##zy##go##us
for
a
g##er##m##line
mutation
in
the
AT##M
gene.
Mu##tations
in
the
AT##M
gene
are
responsible
for
the
auto##so##mal
re##cess##ive
disorder
at##ax##ia-te##lang##ie##ct##asi##a
(A-T)
(MI##M
208##90##0).
The
finding
that
AT##M-he##tero##zy##got##es
have
an
increased
relative
risk
for
breast
cancer
was
supported
by
some
studies
but
not
confirmed
by
others.
In
view
of
this
disc##re##pan##cy,
we
examined
the
frequency
of
AT##M
g##er##m##line
mutations
in
a
selected
group
of
Dutch
patients
with
breast
cancer.
We
have
analyzed
AT##M
g##er##m##line
mutations
in
normal
blood
l##ymph##ocytes,
using
the
protein-t##run##cation
test
followed
by
g##eno##mic-sequence
analysis.
A
high
percentage
of
AT##M
g##er##m##line
mutations
was
demonstrated
among
patients
with
s##poradic
breast
cancer.
The
82
patients
included
in
this
study
had
developed
breast
cancer
at
age
<
45
and
had
survived
>/=
5
years
(mean
15
years),
and
in
33
(40%)
of
the
patients
a
con##tral##ater##al
breast
tumor
had
been
diagnosed.
Among
these
patients
we
identified
seven
(8.
5%)
AT##M
g##er##m##line
mutations,
of
which
five
are
distinct.
One
s##p##lice-site
mutation
(IV##S##10-6##T--
>
G)
was
detected
three
times
in
our
series.
Four
he##tero##zy##go##us
carriers
were
patients
with
bilateral
breast
cancer.
Our
results
indicate
that
the
mutations
identified
in
this
study
are
"
A-T
disease-causing
"
mutations
that
might
be
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
breast
cancer
in
he##tero##zy##got##es.
We
conclude
that
AT##M
he##tero##zy##got##es
have
an
approximately
nine##fold-increased
risk
of
developing
a
type
of
breast
cancer
characterized
by
frequent
bilateral
occurrence,
early
age
at
onset,
and
long-term
survival.
The
specific
characteristics
of
our
population
of
patients
may
explain
why
such
a
high
frequency
was
not
found
in
other
series.

a

In

have
indicated
a
prefer##ential
paternal
transmission
of
mutant
re##tino##blast##oma
all##ele##s
to

suggesting
the
occurrence
of
a
me##iot##ic
drive.
To
investigate
this
mechanism,
we
analyzed
sperm
samples
from
six
individuals
from
five
unrelated
families
affected
with
hereditary
re##tino##blast##oma.
Single-sperm
typing
techniques
were
performed
for
each

by
study
of
two
inform##ative
short

located
either
in
or

to
the
re##tino##blast##oma
gene
(RB##1).
The

was
assessed
by
use
of
the

the
markers,
and
segregation
parameters.
A
total
of
2,
95##2
single

from
the
six

were
analyzed.
We
detected
a
significant
segregation
distortion
in
the
data
as
a
whole
(P
=.
00##9##9)
and
a
significant
he##tero##gene##ity
in
the
segregation
rate
across
donors
(.
00##9##2).
Further
analysis
shows
that
this
result
can
be
explained
by
segregation
distortion
in
favor
of
the
normal
all##ele
in
one
donor
only
and
that
it
does
not
provide
evidence
of
a
significant
segregation
distortion
in
the
other
donors.
The
segregation
distortion
favor##ing
the

does
not
seem
to
occur
during
sperm##ato##genesis,
and,
thus,
me##iot##ic
drive
may
result
either
from
various
mechanisms,
including
a
f##ert##ilization
advantage

a

The

(GA##LT)
gene.
Classical
gal##act##ose##mia
is
caused
by
a
deficiency
in
activity
of
the
enzyme
gal##act##ose-1-phosphate
u##rid##yl
transfer##ase
(GA##LT),
which,
in
turn,
is
caused
by
mutations
at
the
GA##LT
gene.
The
disorder
exhibits
considerable
all##eli##c
he##tero##gene##ity
and,
at
the
end
of
1998,
more
than
150
different
base
changes
were
recorded
in
24
different
populations
and
ethnic
groups
in
15
countries
worldwide.
The
mutations
most
frequently
cited
are
Q##18##8##R,
K##28##5##N,
S##13##5##L,
and
N##31##4##D.
Q##18##8##R
is
the
most
common
mutation
in
European
populations
or
in
those
predominantly
of
European
descent.
Overall,
it
accounts
for
60-70%
of
mutant
chromosome##s,
but
there
are
significant
differences
in
its
relative
frequency
in
individual
populations.
Individuals
ho##mo##alle##lic
for
Q##18##8##R
tend
to
have
a
severe
p##hen##otype
and
this
is
in
keeping
with
the
virtually
complete
loss
of
enzyme
activity
observed
in
in
v##it##ro
expression
systems.
Global##ly,
K##28##5##N
is
rare##r,
but
in
many
European
populations
it
can
be
found
on
25-40%
of
mutant
chromosome##s.
It
is
in##var##iably
associated
with
a
severe
p##hen##otype.
S##13##5##L
is
found
almost
exclusively
in
African
Americans.
In
v##it##ro
expression
results
are
disc##re##pan##t,
but
some
individuals
carrying
S##13##5##L
appear
to
exhibit
GA##LT
activity
in
some
tissues.

even
though
D##1
is
associated
with
increased
er##yt##hr##oc##yte
GA##LT
activity
and

with
reduced

with
other
base

that

N##31##4##D
does
not
imp##air
GA##LT

in

However,
there
are
differences
in
the
abundance
of
GA##LT
protein
in
l##ymph##ob##last##oid
cells
lines
from
D##2
and
D##1
individuals.
It
is
unclear
whether
the
specific
molecular
changes
that
distinguish
the
D##1
and
D##2
all##ele##s
account
for
the
different
activities.
The

documented

undoubtedly
contributes
to
the

Mu##tations
of

are
lethal,
identified
first
in
the

subsequently
in

The

includes
de##gene##ration
and
premature

Il##e-to-T##hr
at

P##LP.
Sur##p##rising##ly,

have
normal

and
a
full

H##y##po##my##elin##ation
can
thus
be
genetically

Child##hood
AL##D

between
5-12
years
of
age.
Central

AM##N
is
a

with
onset
at
15-30
years
of

and
a
more
progressive

may
remain
the
only
clinical
manifest##ation
of

The
principal
bio##chemical
abnormal##ity
of
AL##D
is
the
accumulation
of
very-long-chain
fatty

of
impaired
beta-oxidation
in
per##ox##is##ome##s.
The
normal

suggested
that
the

could
be
a

gene
for
AL##D.
Here

F##ami##lial
ne##uro##hy##pop##hy##sea##l
diabetes
ins##ip##id##us
is
an
auto##so##mal
dominant
disorder
characterized
by
post-na##tal
development
of
a##rg##ini##ne
v##as##op##ress##in
(A##VP)
deficiency
due
to
mutations
in
the
A##VP
gene.
All
published
mutations
affect
the
signal
p##eptide
or
the
ne##uro##phy##sin-II
carrier
protein
and
are
presumed
to
interfere
with
processing
of
the
pre##p##ro##hor##mon##e,
leading
to
ne##uron##al
damage.
We
studied
an
unusual
Palestinian
family
consisting
of
as##ym##pt##oma##tic
first
cousin
parents
and
three
children
affected
with
ne##uro##hy##pop##hy##sea##l
diabetes
ins##ip##id##us,
suggesting
auto##so##mal
re##cess##ive
inheritance.
All
three
affected
children
were
ho##mo##zy##go##us
and
the
parents
he##tero##zy##go##us
for
a
single
novel

(C##30##1-
>
T)
in
ex##on

replacing
Pro##7
of
mature
A##VP
with
Le##u
(Le##u-A##VP).
Le##u-A##VP
was
a
weak
ago##nist
with
approximately
30-fold
reduced
binding
to
the
human
V##2
receptor.
Me##as##ured
by
radio##im##mu##no##ass##ay
with
a
synthetic
Le##u-A##VP
standard,
serum
Le##u-A##VP
levels
were
elevated
in
all
three
children
and
further
increased
during
water
de##p##ri##vation
to
as
high
as
30
times
normal.
The
youngest
child
(2
years
old)
was
only
mildly
affected
but
had
Le##u-A##VP
levels
similar
to
her
severely
affected
8-year-old
brother,
suggesting
that
unknown
mechanisms
may
partially
compensate
for
a

Recently,
this
auto##so##mal

was
shown
to
be
caused
by
mutations
in
the
PD##S
gene,
which
en##codes
an

called

Molecular
analysis
of
the

was
performed
in
two

large

from
Southern
Tunisia
comprising
a
total
of
23
individuals
affected
with
profound
con##gen##ital

the

L##44##5##W,
was
identified
in
all
affected

A

was
found
in
all
patients
who
underwent

In

in
only
11
affected
individuals,
who
interesting##ly
had
a
normal

of
the

whenever
performed.
The

question
the
sensitivity
of
the

for
the

of

and
support
the

The

by
the
site
of
the

mutation:
a

to
K##nu##dson's
'two-hit'
hypothesis.
AP##C
is
often
cited
as
a
prime
example
of
a
tumor
suppress##or
gene.
T##run##cating
g##er##m##line
and

(or,
in##f##re##quent##ly,
all##eli##c

occur
in
tumors
in
FA##P
(f##ami##lial
ad##eno##mat##ous
p##oly##po##sis).
Most

also
have
two
AP##C
mutations.
C##lue##s

variants
with
mild
disease
and
the
so##matic

cluster
region
(co##don##s
1,
250-1,
450)
indicate,
however,
that
AP##C
mutations
might
not
result
in
simple
loss
of
protein
function.
We
have
found
that
FA##P
patients
with
g##er##m##line
AP##C
mutations
within
a
small
region
(co##don##s
1,
194-1,
39##2
at

mainly
show
all##eli##c

in
their
color##ec##tal

in
contrast
to
other
FA##P
patients,
whose
second
hits
tend
to
occur
by
t##run##cating
mutations
in
the
mutation
cluster
region.
Our
results
indicate
that
different
AP##C
mutations
provide
cells
with
different
selective
advantages,
with
mutations
close
to
co##don
1,
300
providing
the
greatest
advantage.
All##eli##c
loss
is
selected
strongly
in
cells
with
one
mutation
near
co##don
1,
300.
A
different
g##er##m##line-so##matic
AP##C
mutation
association
exists
in
FA##P
des##mo##ids.
AP##C
is
not,
therefore,
a
classical
tumor
suppress##or.
Our
findings
also
indicate
a
new
mechanism
for
disease
severity
if
a
broader
spectrum
of
mutations
is
selected
in
tumors,
the
so##matic
mutation
rate
is
effectively
higher
and

We
report
here
a
newly
identified
HP##RT
mutation
in
a
Japanese
patient
with
Les##ch-N##y##han
syndrome.
This
gene,
designated
HP##RT
Tokyo,
had
a
single
n##uc##leo##tide
change
from
G
to
A,
as
identified
by
se##quencing
c##D##NA
am##plified
by
the
polymer##ase

reaction.
All##ele
specific
o##li##gon##uc##leo##tide
hybrid##ization
analysis
using
am##plified
g##eno##mic
DNA
showed
that
the
mutant
gene
was
transmitted
from
the
maternal
g##er##m
line.
This
mutation
would
lead
to
an
amino
acid
substitution
of
As##p
for
G##ly
at
the
amino
acid
position
140
located
within
the
put##ative
5-p##hos##ph##ori##bos##yl-1-p##yr##op##hos##phate

binding
region.
Miss##ense
mutations
in
human
HP##RT
def##icient
patients
thus
far
reported
tend
to
a##cc##um##ulate
in
this
functional##ly
active
region.
However,
a
comparison
of
the
data
suggested
that
both
miss##ense
and
synonymous
mutations
can
occur
at
any
coding
sequence
of
the
human
g##er##m
line
HP##RT
gene,
but
that
a
limited
percentage
of
all
the
miss##ense
mutations
cause
disease.
The
probability
that
a
mutation
will
cause
disease
tends
to
be
higher
when
the
miss##ense
mutation
is
within
a

became
even
more
so
when

mainly
p##eptide-binding,

H##F##E

to
perform
an

essential

As
yet,
our
understanding
of
H##F##E
function
in

is
only
partial;
an
even
more
open
question
is
its
possible
role
in
the

The

In

The
W##isk##ott-Al##dric##h
syndrome
(WA##S)
is
caused
by
defects
in
the
WA##S
protein
(WA##SP)
gene
on
the
X
chromosome.
Previous
study
disclosed
that
flow
c##yt##ometric
analysis
of
in##tra##cellular
WA##SP
expression
(FC##M-WA##SP
analysis)
in
l##ymph##ocytes
was
useful
for
the
diagnosis
of
WA##S
patients.
L##ymph##ocytes
from
all
WA##S
patients
showed
WA##SP##di##m
instead
of
WA##SP##bright.
Here
we
report
that
FC##M-WA##SP
analysis
in
mon##ocytes
could
be
a
useful
tool
for
the
WA##S
carrier
diagnosis.
Mon##ocytes
from
all
nine
WA##S
carriers
showed
varied
population
of
WA##SP##di##m
together
with
WA##SP##bright.
None
of
control
individuals
possessed
the
WA##SP##di##m
population.
In
contrast,
l##ymph##ocytes
from
all
the
carriers
except
two
lacked
the
WA##SP##di##m
population.
The
difference
of
the
WA##SP##di##m
population
in
mon##ocytes
and
l##ymph##ocytes
observed
in
WA##S
carriers
suggests
that
WA##SP
plays
a
more
critical
role
in
the
development
of
l##ymph##ocytes
than
in
that
of
mon##ocytes.
The
present
studies
suggest
that
a
s##ke##wed
X-ch##rom##oso##mal

pattern
observed
in
WA##S

is
not

Analysis
with

at

suggested
segregation
of
both

with
an

This
indicated
that
non##ne##ona##tal
AL##D
and
AM##N
are
caused
by
a
mutation
in
the

at

It

that

the

Molecular

in
patients
of
Chinese
descent
and
identification
of
new
base
substitution##s
in
the
human
G##6##PD
gene.
The
underlying
DNA
changes
associated
with
glucose-6-phosphate
de##hy##dr##ogen##ase
(G##6##PD)
-def##icient
Asian##s
have
not
been
extensively
investigated.
To
fill
this
gap,
we
sequence##d
the
G##6##PD
gene
of
43
G##6##PD-def##icient
Chinese
whose
G##6##PD
was
well
characterized
bio##chemical##ly.
DNA
samples
were
obtained
from
peripheral
blood
of
these
individuals
for
se##quencing
using
a
direct
polymer##ase
chain
reaction
(PC##R)
se##quencing
procedure.
From
these
43
samples,
we
have
identified
five
different
types
of
n##uc##leo##tide
substitution##s
in
the
G##6##PD
gene
at
c##D##NA
138##8
from
G
to

(A##rg
to
His);
at
c##D##NA
137##6
from
G

(A##rg

(Le##u

from
G
to
T
(G##ly
to
Val);
at
c##D##NA
95
from
A
to
G
(His
to
A##rg).
These
five
n##uc##leo##tide
substitution##s
account
for
over
83%
of
our
43
G##6##PD-def##icient
samples
and
these
substitution##s
have
not
been
reported
in
non-Asian##s.
The
substitution##s
found
at
c##D##NA
39##2
and
c##D##NA
102##4
are
new
findings.
The
substitution##s
at
c##D##NA
137##6
and
138##8
account
for
over
50%
of
the
43
samples
examined
indicating
a
high
prevalence
of
these
two
all##ele##s
among
G##6##PD-def##icient
Chinese.
Our
findings
add
support
to
the
notion
that
diverse

may
account
largely
for
much
of
the

Nor##rie

gene:
characterization
of
del##eti##ons
and
possible
function.
Po##si##tional
c##lon##ing
experiments
have
resulted
recently
in
the
isolation
of
a
candidate
gene
for
Nor##rie
disease
(pseudo##gli##oma;
NDP),
a
severe
X-linked
ne##uro##de##vel##op##mental
disorder.
Here
we
report
the
isolation
and
analysis
of
human
g##eno##mic
DNA
clone##s
encompassing
the
NDP
gene.
The
gene
spans
28
k##b
and
consists
of
3
ex##ons,
the
first
of
which
is
entirely
contained
within
the
5
un##tra##ns##lated
region.
Det##ailed
analysis
of
g##eno##mic
del##eti##ons
in
Nor##rie
patients
shows
that
they
are
he##tero##gene##ous,
both
in
size
and
in
position.
By
PC##R
analysis,
we
found
that
expression
of
the
NDP
gene
was
not
confined
to
the
eye
or
to
the
brain.
An
extensive
DNA
and
protein
sequence
comparison
between
the
human
NDP
gene
and
related
genes
from
the
database
revealed
ho##mology
with
c##ys##tein##e-rich
protein-binding
domains
of
immediate--early
genes
implicated
in
the
regulation
of
cell
proliferation.
We
propose
that
NDP
is
a
molecule
related
in
function
to
these
genes
and
may
be
involved
in
a
pathway
that
regulate##s
neural
cell
differentiation
and
proliferation..
Pre##nat##al

Two

were
monitored
by
ass##ay
and
electro##ph##ores##is
of
acid

in

am##nio##tic-fluid
cells.
Cell##s
from
patient
1
had
5%
of
control
levels
of
acid
lip##ase,
using
14##C-trio##lein
as
substrate;
however,
when
artificial
substrates
(est##ers
of
4-met##hyl##um##bell##ifer##one
and
p-ni##tro##phe##no##l)
were
used
to
measure
acid
lip##ase,
these
cells
had
30%
of
control
levels.
El##ec##tro##ph##ores##is
of
cell
extract##s
revealed
the
absence
of
the
A
form
of
acid
lip##ase,
consistent
with
the
diagnosis
of
W##olm##an
disease.
Analysis
of
f##etal
tissues
following
pro##sta##g##land##in
termination
of
this
pregnancy
confirmed
the
diagnosis.
As##say
of
f##etal-skin
fi##bro##blast##s
with
14##C-trio##lein,
as
well
as
with
artificial
substrates,
showed
marked
deficiency
of
acid
lip##ase
activity.
El##ec##tro##ph##ores##is
of
f##etal-tissue
extract##s
also
demonstrated
the
absence
of
the
A
form
of
acid
lip##ase.
Am##nio##tic-fluid
cells
from
patient
2
showed
normal
levels
of
acid
lip##ase
with
all
substrates
tested;
the
electro##ph##ore##tic
pattern
of
acid
lip##ase
was
normal.
The
results
suggest
that
the
pre##nat##al
diagnosis
of
W##olm##an
disease
be
made
using
the
radio##ass##ay
of
acid
lip##ase
and/or

So##matic
mutations
in
the
BR##CA##1
gene
in
s##poradic
o##var##ian
t##umour##s.
The
BR##CA##1
gene
on
chromosome
17##q##21
is
responsible
for
an
auto##so##mal
dominant
syndrome
of
increased
su##s##ce##pt##ibility
to
breast
and
o##var##ian
cancer
but
no
so##matic

in

have
yet
been
described.
To
study
the
potential
role
of
BR##CA##1
in
s##poradic
car##cin##ogen##esis,
we
anal##ys##ed
the
g##eno##mic
DNA
of

and
normal
fraction##s
of
47
o##var##ian
cancer##s
for

We
now
describe

in
the

of
four
t##umour##s
which
also
had
loss
of
he##tero##zy##gos##ity
(L##OH)
at
a

marker.
Our
data
support
a
t##umour
suppress##or
mechanism
for
BR##CA##1;
so##matic
mutations
and
L##OH
may
result
in
in##act##ivation
of

in

S##ke##wed

in
a

M##Z
twin
results
in
Du##chen##ne
muscular
d##ys##tro##phy.
One
of
female
M##Z
twins
presented
with
muscular
d##ys##tro##phy.
Physical
examination,
c##rea##tine
p##hos##ph##oki##nas##e
levels,
and
muscle
bio##psy
were
consistent
with
Du##chen##ne
muscular
d##ys##tro##phy
(D##MD).
However,
because
of
her
sex
she
was
diagnosed
as
having
limb-g##ir##dle
muscular
d##ys##tro##phy.
With
c##D##NA
probe##s
to
the
D##MD
gene,
a
gene
del##eti##on
was
detected
in
the
twins
and
their
mother.
The
de
no##vo
mutation
which
arose
in
the
mother
was
shown
by
novel
junction
fragments
generated
by
Hi##nd##II##I,
P##st##I,
or
Ta##q##I
when
probe##d
with
c##D##NA##8.
Additional
evidence
of
a
large
gene
del##eti##on
was
given
by
novel
S##fi##I
junction
fragments
detected
by
probe##s
p##20,
J-B##ir,
and
J-66
on
pulsed-field
gel
electro##ph##ores##is
(P##F##GE).
I##mm##uno##b##lot
analysis
of
muscle
from
the
affected
twin
showed
d##ys##tro##phi##n
of
normal
size
but
of
reduced
amount.
I##mm##uno##f##lu##ores##cent
visual##ization
of
d##ys##tro##phi##n
revealed
f##oc##i
of
d##ys##tro##phi##n-positive
fibers
adjacent
to
f##oc##i
of
d##ys##tro##phi##n-negative
fibers.
These
data
indicate
that
the
affected
twin
is
a
manifest##ing
carrier
of
an
abnormal
D##MD
gene,
her
my##op##athy
being
a
direct
result
of
under##ex##press##ion
of
d##ys##tro##phi##n.
Cy##to##gene##tic
analysis
revealed
normal
ka##ryo##type##s,
eliminating
the
possibility
of
a
trans##location
affecting
D##MD
gene
function.
Both
link##age
analysis
and
DNA
finger##print
analysis
revealed
that
each
twin
has
two
different
X
chromosome##s,
eliminating
the
possibility
of
un##ip##are##ntal
di##so##my
as
a
mechanism
for
D##MD
expression.
On
the
basis
of
met##hyl##ation
differences
of
the
paternal
and
maternal
X
chromosome##s
in
these
M##Z
twins,
we
propose
uneven
l##yon##ization
(X

in##act##ivation)
as
the
underlying
mechanism
for
disease
expression
in
the
affected

The

Combined
genetic
deficiency
of
C##6
and
C##7
in
man.
By
routine
screening
of
se##ra,
a
subject
was
discovered
who
showed
a
sub-total
deficiency
of
C##6
and
C##7.
No
clinical
disease
was
associated
with
this
deficiency
which
was
transmitted
through
the
subjects
family
as
a
single
genetic
characteristic,
the
C##6
deficiency
being
associated
with
a
silent
all##ele
at
the
structural
lo##cus.
The
prop##os##it##us
was
found
to
have
low
quantities
of
an
abnormal
C##6
which
was
both
anti##genic##ally
def##icient
and
smaller
in
size
than
normal
C##6
(110,
000
da##lton##s
compared
with
140,
000
da##lton##s)
and
small
quantities
of
apparently
normal
C##7.
It
is
concluded
that
the
most
likely
explanation
for
this
defect
is
that
the
subject
has
a
structural
mutation
in
his
C##6
gene
which
produces
h##yo##psy##nt##hesis
not
only
of
C##6
but
also
of
the
closely
linked
gene
for
C##7.
These
findings
suggest
the
possibility
that
C##6
and
C##7
may
function
as
a
single
genetic
unit
and
that
the
primary
trans##cript
copied
from
the
genome
includes
information
for
both
proteins..

an

Fr##ata##xin
is
a

among
e##uka##ryo##tes.
Gene##tic
in##act##ivation
of

results
in

have
also
been
observed
in

These

indicate
that
f##rata##xin
is
essential
for
mitochondrial
iron

and
protection
from
iron-induced
formation
of

The

of

is
still
unknown.

Each

consists
of
approximately

T##it##ration
of

supports
a

mechanism
of

Se##quential

results
in

In

We

G##lu##cos##e

is
to

or

We
show
here
that
an
evolutionary
analysis
is
a
key
to
understanding
the
biology
of
a
house##keeping

From
the

(a##a)
sequence
of
52
glucose
6-phosphate
de##hy##dr##ogen##ase
(G##6##PD)
species
from
42
different
organisms,
we
found
a
striking
correlation
between
the
a##a
replacement##s
that
cause
G##6##PD
deficiency
in
humans
and
the
sequence
conservation
of
G##6##PD
two-thirds
of
such
replacement##s
are
in
highly
and
moderately
conserved
(50-99%)
a##a;
relatively
few
are
in
fully
conserved
a##a
(where
they
might
be
lethal)
or
in
poorly
conserved
a##a,
where
presumably
they
simply
would
not
cause
G##6##PD
deficiency.
This
is
consistent
with
the
notion
that
all
human
mutant##s
have
residual
enzyme
activity
and
that
null
mutations
are
lethal
at
some
stage
of
development.
Co##mp##aring
the
distribution
of
mutations
in
a
human
house##keeping
gene
with
evolutionary

is
a
useful
tool
for
pin##point##ing
amino

for
the

or
the
function
of
the
corresponding

In

of

this
tool
will
become
rapidly

A

In

all

detected
in

were
located
prior
to

The
frequent

may
explain
the

Analysis

hot

in
the

di##ox##y##gen##ase

(H##G##O).
We
recently
showed
that
al##ka##pton##uria
(AK##U)
is
caused
by
loss-of-function
mutations
in
the
ho##mo##gent##isa##te

2
di##ox##y##gen##ase
gene
(H##G##O).
Here##in
we
describe
ha##p##lot##ype
and
mutation##al
analyses
of
H##G##O
in
seven
new
AK##U
p##ed##ig##ree##s.
These
analyses
identified
two
novel

p##oly##mor##phism##s
(IN##V##4

31##A--

G
and
IN##V##11

and
six

(IN##V##1-1##G--

A,
W##60##G,
Y##6##2##C,
A1##22##D,

and
D##29##1##E),
which
further
illustrate##s
the
remarkable

found

AK##U.
Re##ex##ami##nation
of
all
29
mutations
and
p##oly##mor##phism##s
thus
far
described
in
H##G##O
shows
that
these
n##uc##leo##tide
changes
are
not
randomly
distributed;
the
CC##C
sequence
motif
and
its
inverted
complement,
G##G##G,
are
prefer##ential##ly
m##uta##ted.
These
analyses
also
demonstrated
that
the
n##uc##leo##tide
substitution##s
in
H##G##O
do
not
involve
C##p##G
din##uc##leo##tide##s,
which
illustrate##s
important
differences
between
H##G##O
and
other
genes
for
the
occurrence
of
mutation
at
specific
short-sequence
motifs.
Because
the
CC##C
sequence
motifs
comprise
a
significant
proportion
(34.
5%)
of
all
m##uta##ted
bases
that
have
been
observed
in

we
conclude
that
the

A

one
miss##ense

(Cy##s##16##3##S##er)
being
responsible
for
the
majority
of
Finnish
cases.
We
were
able
to
examine
66
Finnish
AG##U
patients
for
changes
in
the
oral
m##uc##osa
and
44
of
these
for
changes
in
facial
skin.
B##io##psy
specimens
of
16
oral
lesions,
12
of
them
associated
with
the
teeth,
plus
two
facial

were
studied
his##to##logical##ly.
I##mm##uno##his##to##chemical

for
AG##A
was
performed
on
15

Skin
was
se##bor##r##hoe##ic
in
adolescent

adult
patients,
with
er##yt##hem##a
of
the
facial

already
common
in

Of
44
patients,
nine
(20%)
had
facial

Of

did
not
differ
from

Thus,
the
high

does
not
appear
to
be
directly

Molecular

in
two
Japanese

with

and
identified
N##31##4##D
and
R##33##3##W
mutations,
previously
found
in
Caucasian##s.
One
novel
miss##ense
mutation
was
an
G-to-A
transition
in
ex##on
8,
resulting
in
the
substitution
of
a##rg##ini##ne
by
his##ti##dine
at
the
co##don
231
(R##23##1##H).
GA##LT
activity
of
the
R##23##1##H
mutant
construct
was
reduced
to
15%
of
normal
controls
in
a
CO##S
cell
expression
system.
The
other
was
a
s##p##licing
mutation,
an
A-to-G
transition
at
the
38th
n##uc##leo##tide
in
ex##on

(31##8##A--

resulting

In
seven
Japanese

(14
all##ele##s
for
classic

Du##arte
variant)
with
GA##LT

the
R##23##1##H
and
31##8##A--

G
mutations
were
found
only
on
both

of
the

The
N##31##4##D
and
R##33##3##W
mutations
were
found
on
one
all##ele
each.
The
Q##18##8##R
was
prevalent
in
the
United
States
but
not
in
Japanese
patients.
The
N##31##4##D
mutation
was
associated
with
the
Du##arte
variant
in
Japanese
persons,
as
well
as
in
the
United
States.
We
s##pec##ulate
that
classic

mutations
appear
to
differ
between
Japanese
and
Caucasian
patients.
Our
limited
data
set
on
gal##act##ose##mia
mutations
in
Japanese
suggests
that
the
N##31##4##D
GA##LT
mutation
encoding
the
Du##arte

arose
before
Asian
and
Caucasian
people
diver##ged
and
that

We

by

The

the

The

is
very
difficult;
it
is
particularly
hampered
by

well
as
by
the

For

traditional

could
prove
of

the

We

embarked
upon
a

the

Natural

in

to
severe

G##lu##cos##e-6-phosphate
de##hy##dr##ogen##ase
(G##6##PD)
deficiency,
the
most
common
en##zy##mo##pathy
of
humans,
affects
over
400
million
people.
The
geographical
correlation
of
its
distribution
with
the
historical
endemic##ity
of
malaria
suggests
that
this
disorder
has
risen
in
frequency
through
natural
selection
by
malaria.
However,
attempts
to
confirm
that
G##6##PD
deficiency
is
protective
in
case-control
studies
of
malaria
have
yielded
conflicting
results.
Hence,
for
this
X-linked
disorder,
it
is
unclear
whether
both
male
hem##iz##y##got##es
and
female
he##tero##zy##got##es
are
protected
or,
as
frequently
suggested,
only
females.
Furthermore,
how
much
protection
may
be
afforded
is
unknown.
Here
we
report
that,
in
two
large
case-control
studies
of
over
2,
000
African
children,
the
common
African
form
of
G##6##PD
deficiency
(G##6##PD
A-)
is
associated
with
a
46-58%
reduction
in
risk
of
severe
malaria
for
both
female
he##tero##zy##got##es
and
male
hem##iz##y##got##es.
A
mathematical
model
incorporating
the
measured
selective
advantage
against
malaria
suggests
that
a
counter##bal##an##cing
selective
disadvantage,
associated
with
this
enzyme
deficiency,
has
re##tar##ded
its
rise
in
frequency
in
malaria-endemic
regions.
Although
G##6##PD
deficiency
is
now
regarded
as
a
generally
ben##ign
disorder,
in
earlier
environmental
conditions
it
could
have
been
significantly
disadvantage##ous..

We
report
a
novel
T##SD
all##ele
in
the
French-Canadian
population
associated
with
the
infant##ile
form
of
the
disease.
The

a

A

at
the

position
of

a##bol##ishes
the

Culture##d

from
a

he##tero##zy##got##e
for
this
transition
(and
for
a
del##eti##on
mutation)
produce
no
detect##able
H##EX##A
m##RNA.
The
intro##n
7
+
1
mutation
occurs
in
the
base
adjacent
to
the
site
of
the
adult-onset
T##SD
mutation
(G##80##5##A).
In
both
mutations
a
restriction
site
for
the
end##on##uc##lea##se
E##co##RI##I
is
abolished.
Una##mb##ig##uous
diagnosis,
therefore,
requires
all##ele-specific
o##li##gon##uc##leo##tide
hybrid##ization
to
distinguish
between
these
two
mutant
all##ele##s.
The
intro##n
7

1
mutation
has
been
detected
in
three
unrelated
families.
O##b##liga##te
he##tero##zy##got##es
for
the
intro##n

1
mutation
were
born
in
the
Sa##gue##nay-Lac-St-Jean
region
of
Quebec.
The
most
recent
ancestors
common
to
o##b##liga##te
carriers
of
this
mutation
were
from
the
Cha##rle##vo##ix
region
of
the
province
of
Quebec.
This
mutation
thus
has
a
different
geographic
centre
of
diffusion
and
is
probably
less
common
than
the
ex##on

del##eti##on
T##SD
mutation
in
French
Canadians.
Neither
mutation
has
been
detected
in
France,
the
ancestral
homeland
of
French
Canada..

We

The

(R##27##9##W)
transition
is
the
most
common
mutation
in
non-Finnish
patients,
but
in
these
disorders
it
is
usually
combined
with
other
D##T##DS##T
mutations.
We
had
not
seen
a
case
of
ho##mo##zy##gos##ity
for
c##86##2##t
(R##27##9##W)
until
we
anal##ys##ed
DNA
from
a
36
year

male
with
tall-normal

(180
cm)
who
asked
for
genetic

for
suspected
multiple

He
was
treated
for
club

at

S##kel##etal
changes
consistent
with
multiple
e##pi##phy##sea##l
d##ys##p##lasia,
with
the
peculiar
finding
of
a
double

were
recognised
during
childhood.
C##le##ft

He
was

and

he##tero##zy##go##us,
for
the
R##27##9##W
mutation
in
D##T##DS##T,
and
his
fi##bro##blast##s
showed
a
su##l##phate

defect
typical
of
D##T##DS##T

Counsel##ling
was
given
for

thereby
considerably
reducing

Multiple

is
more
frequently
caused
by

in
the

132##40##0)
and
CO##L##9##A##2

(E##DM##2,

A
few
other

and
families
with
features
similar
to

have
been
described
previously
and
considered
to
have
auto##so##mal

ME##D
(E##DM##4,
M##c##K##us##ick

This
observation
confirms
the
existence
of
this
entity
and
assigns
it
to
the
p##hen##otypic

associated
with

at
the

My##oto##nic
d##ys##tro##phy
(D##M)
is
a
progressive
ne##uro##mus##cular
disorder
which
results
from
el##ong##ations
of
an
unstable
(CT##G)
n
repeat,
located
in
the
3
un##tra##ns##lated
region
of
the
D##M
gene.
A
correlation
has
been
demonstrated
between
the
increase
in
the
repeat
number
of
this
sequence
and
the
severity
of
the
disease.
However,
the
clinical
status
of
patients
cannot
be
un##am##bi##guous##ly
as##cer##tain##ed
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
number
of
CT##G
repeats.
Moreover,
the
exclusive
maternal
inheritance
of
the
con##gen##ital
form
remains
une##x##plain##ed.
Our
observation
of
differently
sized
repeats
in
various
D##M
tissues
from
the
same
individual
may
explain
why
the
size
of
the
mutation
observed
in
l##ymph##ocytes
does
not
necessarily
co##rrel##ate
with
the
severity
and
nature
of
symptoms.
Through
a
molecular
and
genetic
study
of
142
families
including
41##8
D##M
patients,
we
have
investigated
the
dynamics
of
the
CT##G
repeat
me##iot##ic
instability.
A
positive
correlation
between
the
size
of
the
repeat
and
the
inter##gene##ration##al
en##lar##gement
was
observed
similarly
through
male
and
female
me##ios##es
for
<
or
=
0.
5-k##b
CT##G
sequences.
Beyond
0.
5
k##b,
the
inter##gene##ration##al
variation
was
more
important
through
female
me##ios##es,
whereas
a
tendency
to
compression
was
observed
almost
exclusively
in
male
me##ios##es,
for
>
or
=
1.
5-k##b
fragments.
This
implies
a
size-
and
sex-dependent
me##iot##ic
instability.
Moreover,
segregation
analysis
supports
the
hypothesis
of
a
maternal
as
well
as
a
f##ami##lial
pre##dis##position
for
the
occurrence
of
the

Although
p##yo##der##ma

(P##G)
is
often
associated
with
systemic
diseases,
it
has
not
been
reported
in
association
with

def##ici##encies.
We
describe
an
aggressive
and
ultimately
fatal
case
of
P##G
in
a
patient
with
a
con##gen##ital
C##7

De##fic##ien##cies
of

can
be
associated
with

Em##eri##n
deficiency
at
the
nuclear

in
patients
with

Mu##tations
in
the
ST##A
gene
at
the
X##q##28
lo##cus
have
been
found
in
patients
with
X-linked
Emery-Dr##ei##fu##ss
muscular
d##ys##tro##phy
(E##DM##D).
This
gene
en##codes
a
hit##her##to
unknown
protein
named
em##eri##n.
To
el##uc##ida##te
the
sub##cellular
local##ization
of
em##eri##n,
we
raised
two
anti##ser##a
against
synthetic
p##eptide
fragments
predicted
from
em##eri##n
c##D##NA.
Using
both
anti##ser##a,
we
found
positive
nuclear
membrane
stain##ing
in
skeletal,
cardiac
and
smooth
muscles
in
the
normal
controls
and
in
patients
with
ne##uro##mus##cular
diseases
other
than
E##DM##D.
In
contrast,
a
deficiency
in
im##mu##no##f##lu##ores##cent
stain##ing
of
skeletal
and
cardiac
muscle
from
E##DM##D
patients
was
observed.
A
34
k##D
protein
is
im##mu##nor##ea##ctive
with
the
anti##ser##a--the
protein
is
equivalent
to
that
predicted
for
em##eri##n.
Together,
our
findings
suggest
the
specific
deficiency
of
em##eri##n
in
the
nuclear

of
muscle
cells
in
patients
with

in

and
meta##sta##sis

but
not
in

The
mutation,
an
a##rg##ini##ne-to-c##ys##tein##e
exchange
at
residue
24,
was
part
of
the
CD##K##4
p##eptide
recognized
by
CT##L##s
and
prevented
binding
of
the
CD##K##4
inhibitor
p##16##IN##K##4##a,

not
of

p##27##K##IP##1.
The
same
mutation
was
found
in
one
additional
me##lan##oma
among
28
me##lan##oma##s
analyzed.
These
results
suggest
that
mutation
of
CD##K##4
can
create
a
tumor-specific

and
can
disrupt
the

is
an

(A##VP)
and
is
transmitted
as
an

In

we
have
analyzed
the
A##VP-ne##uro##phy##sin

(A##VP-N##PI##I)
gene
in
a
Spanish
kind##red.
Studies
were
performed
on
seven

(four
clinical##ly
affected)
of
the
family.
Pat##ients
were
diagnosed
at
the
Hospital
Un##ivers##ita##rio
Gregor##io
Mara##non
(Madrid,
Spain).
The
entire
coding
region
of
the
A##VP-N##PI##I
gene
of
all
family
members
was
am##plified
by
PC##R
and
sequence##d.
All
affected
individuals
presented
a

(G##17##5##7--

that
replaces
g##ly##cine
at
position
23
with
a##rg##ini##ne
within
the
N##PI##I
domain.
The
substitution
was
confirmed
by
restriction

and
was
present
in
he##tero##zy##gos##is.
Additionally,
one
of
the
as##ym##pt##oma##tic
relatives
(a
girl
8
months
old
at
the
time
of
study)
was
identified
as
carrier
of
the
same
mutation
and
developed
the
disease
3
months
later.
The
alter##ation
found
in
the
second
ex##on
of
the
gene
in
this
family
seems
to
be
responsible
for
the
disease,
as
all
individuals
harbor##ing
the
mutation
had
been
previously

have
eventually
developed
F##ND##I.

The

has
recently
been
identified
as
an
unstable
and
expanded
(CA##G)
n
t##rin##uc##leo##tide
repeat
in
a
novel
gene
of
unknown
function.
In
Caucasian##s,
repeat
expansion##s
in
the
M##J##D##1
gene
have
also
been
found
in
patients
with
the
clinical##ly
distinct
auto##so##mal
dominant
spin##oc##ere##bella##r
at##ax##ia
type
3
(SC##A##3).
In
order
to
gain
insight
into
the
biology
of
the
M##J##D##1/SC##A##3
gene
we
clone##d
the
rat
ho##mo##logue
and
studied
its
expression.
The
rat
and
human
at##ax##in-3
genes
are
highly
ho##mo##log##ous
with
an
overall
sequence
identity
of
approximately
88%.
However,
the
C-terminal
end
of
the
put##ative
protein
differs
strongly
from
the
published
human
sequence.
The
(CA##G)
n
block
in
the
rat
c##D##NA
consists
of
just
three
interrupted
units
suggesting
that
a
long
p##oly##g##lut##amine
stretch
is
not
essential
for
the
normal
function
of
the
at##ax##in-3
protein
in
rode##nts.
The
expression
pattern
of
the
SC##A##3
gene
in
various
rat
and
human
tissues
was
investigated
by
Northern
b##lot
analyses.
The
mature
trans##cript
is
approximately
6
k##b
in
length.
In
rat
test##is,
a
smaller
trans##cript
of
1.
3
k##b
was
identified.
Trans##cription
of
r##sca##3
was
detected
in
most
rat
tissues
including
brain.
Ana##ly##zing
the

of
the

gene
in
several
human
brain
sections
revealed
no
significant
higher
m##RNA
level
in
regions
predominantly
affected
in
M##J##D.
Thus
additional
molecules
and/or
regulatory
events
are
necessary
to
explain
the
exclusive
de##gene##ration
of
certain
brain
areas.

to
the
bi##sect##ed

domain
of
FK##H##R,
a
member
of
the
fork##head
family
of
transcription

Here
we
report
that
PA##X##3
and
PA##X##3/FK##H##R
display
similar,
but
not
identical
trans##act##ivation
activities
when
tested

No
functional
role
could
be
as##cribed
solely
to
the
residual

binding
domain
present
in
the
fusion
protein,
but
FK##H##R
was
found
to
contribute
a
strong
car##box##yl
terminal
activation
domain
replacing
the
one
located
in
the

We
show
that
the

Dom##ina##nt
my##oto##nia
con##gen##ita
(Thom##sen##s
disease)
is
linked
to
C##LC##N##1,
the
gene
encoding
the
major
muscle
chloride
channel,
localized
on
chromosome
7##q##35.
In
contrast,
dominant
my##oto##nia##s
sensitive
to
potassium
are
caused
by
point
mutations
in
SC##N##4##A
on
chromosome
17##q,
the
gene
for
the
alpha
subunit
of
the
adult
skeletal
muscle
sodium
channel.
No

or
molecular
genetic
data
are
as
yet
available
on
my##oto##nia
le##vior
characterized
by
mild##er
symptoms
and
later
onset
of
my##oto##nia
than
in
Thom##sen##s
disease,
and
absence
of
muscle
h##yper##tro##phy.
We
report
a
C##LC##N##1
G##ln-55##2-A##rg
substitution
for
a
family
with
dominant
inheritance
previously
diagnosed
to
have
my##oto##nia
le##vior.
Thus,
this
disorder
appears
as
a
variant
of
Thom##sen##s
disease
due
to
mutations
leading
to
low
clinical
express##ivity.
In
addition,
we
report
a
novel
Il##e-290-Met
C##LC##N##1
mutation
for
a
typical
Thom##sen
p##ed##ig##ree.
In
another
family
previously
diagnosed
as
having
Thom##sen##s
disease,
we
unexpectedly
found
a
C##LC##N##1

b##p

known
to
cause
re##cess##ive
my##oto##nia,
and

and

Classic
(complete)
le##ci##thin
ch##ole##ster##ol
a##cy##lt##ran##s##fer##ase
(L##CA##T)
deficiency
and
Fish-eye
disease
(partial
L##CA##T

are
genetic
syndrome##s
associated
with
marked##ly
decreased
plasma
levels
of
high
density
lip##op##rote##in
(HD##L)
ch##ole##ster##ol
but
not
with
an
increased
risk
of
at##her##os##cle##rot##ic
card##iovascular
disease.
We
investigated
the
metabolism
of
the
HD##L
a##poli##pop##rote##ins
(a##po)
a##po##A-I
and
a##po##A-II
in
a
total
of
five
patients
with
L##CA##T
deficiency,
one
with
classic
L##CA##T
deficiency
and
four
with
Fish-eye
disease.
P##las##ma
levels
of
a##po##A-II
were
decreased
to
a
proportion##ately
greater
extent
(23%
of
normal)
than
a##po##A-I
(30%
of
normal).
In
addition,
plasma
concentrations
of
HD##L
particles
containing
both
a##po##A-I
and
a##po##A-II
(L##p##A-I
A-II)
were
much
lower
(18%
of
normal)
than
those
of
particles
containing
only
a##po##A-I
(L##p##A-I)
(51%
of
normal).
The
metabolic
basis
for
the
low
levels
of
a##po##A-II
and
L##p##A-I
A-II
was
investigated
in
all
five
patients
using
both
ex##ogen##ous
radio##tra##cer
and
end##ogen##ous
stable
is##oto##pe
label##ing
techniques.
The
mean
plasma
residence
time
of
a##po##A-I
was
decreased
at
2.
08
+/-
0.
27
d
(controls
4.
74
+/-
0.
65
days);
however,
the
residence
time
of
a##po##A-II
was
even
shorter
at
1.
66
+/-
0.
24
d
(controls
5.
25
+/-
0.
61
d).
In
addition,
the
cat##ab##olis##m
of
a##po##A-I
in
L##p##A-I
A-II
was
substantially
faster
than
that
of
a##po##A-I
in
L##p##A-I.
In
summary,
genetic
syndrome##s
of
either
complete
or
partial
L##CA##T
deficiency
result
in
low
levels
of
HD##L
through
prefer##ential
h##yper##cat##ab##olis##m
of
a##po##A-II
and
HD##L
particles
containing
a##po##A-II.
Because
L##p##A-I
has
been
proposed
to
be
more
protective
than
L##p##A-I
A-II
against
at##her##os##cle##rosis,
this
selective
effect
on
the
metabolism
of
L##p##A-I
A-II
may
provide
a
potential
explanation
why
patients
with
classic
L##CA##T
deficiency
and
Fish-eye
disease
are
not
at
increased
risk
for
premature
at##her##os##cle##rosis
despite
marked##ly
decreased

We

of
a
5
AP##C
g##er##m##line
mutation
in
five
separately
as##cer##tain##ed

This

a

The

(F##8##C),
in

was
also

Multi##point

with
the

indicated
that
both

In
four

to
be
of

mutations.
Gene##tic
hem##och##roma##tosis
(G##H)
is
believed
to
be
a
disease
restricted
to
those
of
European
ancestry.
In
northwestern
Europe,
>
80%
of
G##H
patients
are
ho##mo##zy##go##us
for
one
mutation,
the
substitution
of
t##yr##os##ine
for
c##ys##tein##e
at
position
28##2
(C##28##2##Y)
in
the
un##p##ro##cess##ed
protein.
In
a
proportion
of
G##H
patients,
two
mutations
are
present,
C##28##2##Y
and
H##6##3##D.
The
clinical
significance
of
this
second
mutation
is
such
that
it
appears
to
pre##dis##pose
1%
-2%
of
compound
he##tero##zy##got##es
to
expression
of
the
disease.
The
distribution
of
the
two
mutations
differ,
C##28##2##Y
being
limited
to
those
of
northwestern
European
ancestry
and
H##6##3##D
being
found
at
all##ele
frequencies
>
5%,
in
Europe,
in
countries
bordering
the
Mediterranean,
in
the
Middle
East,
and
in
the
Indian
sub##continent.
The
C##28##2##Y
mutation
occurs
on
a
ha##p##lot##ype
that
extends
</=
6
M##b,
suggesting
that
this
mutation
has
arise##n
during
the
past
2,
000
years.
The
H##6##3##D
mutation
is
older
and
does
not
occur
on
such
a
large
extended
ha##p##lot##ype,
the
ha##p##lot##ype
in
this
case
extending
</=
700

Here
we
report
the
finding
of
the
H##6##3##D
and
C##28##2##Y
mutations
on
new
ha##p##lot##ype##s.
In
Sri
Lanka
we
have
found
H##6##3##D
on
three
new
ha##p##lot##ype##s
and
have
found
C##28##2##Y
on
one
new
ha##p##lot##ype,
demonstrating
that
these
mutations
have
arise##n
independently
on
this
island.
These
results
suggest
that
the
H##F##E
gene
has
been
the
subject
of
selection
pressure.
These
selection
pressures
could
be
due
to
infectious
diseases,
environmental

or
other
genetic

g##eno##type-genetic
and

F##ami##lial
Mediterranean
fever
(FM##F)
is
a
re##cess##ively
inherited
disorder
that
is
common
in
patients
of
Armenian
ancestry.
To
date,
its
diagnosis,
which
can
be
made
only
retrospective##ly,
is
one
of
exclusion,
based
entirely
on
non##sp##ec##ific
clinical
signs
that
result
from
se##ros##al
inflammation
and
that
may
lead
to
unnecessary
surgery.
Ren##al
am##yl##oid##osis,
prevented
by
co##l##chi##cine,
is
the
most
severe
com##plication
of
FM##F,
a
disorder
associated
with
mutations
in
the
ME##F##V
gene.
To
evaluate
the
diagnostic
and
pro##gno##stic
value
of
ME##F##V-gene
analysis,
we
investigated
90
Armenian
FM##F
patients
from
77
unrelated
families
that
were
not
selected
through
genetic-link##age
analysis.
Eight
mutations,
one
of
which
(R##40##8##Q)
is
new,
were
found
to
account
for
93%
of
the
163
independent
FM##F
all##ele##s,
with
both
FM##F
all##ele##s
identified
in
89%
of
the
patients.
In
several
instances,
family
studies
provided
molecular
evidence
for
pseudo##dom##ina##nt
transmission
and
incomplete
pen##et##rance
of
the
disease
p##hen##otype.
The
M##6##9##4##V
ho##mo##zy##go##us
g##eno##type
was
found
to
be
associated
with
a
higher
prevalence
of
re##nal
am##yl##oid##osis
and
art##hr##itis,
compared
with
other
g##eno##type##s
(P
=.
000##2
and
P
=.
00##6,
respectively).
The
demonstration
of
both
the
diagnostic
and
pro##gno##stic
value
of
ME##F##V
analysis
and
particular
modes
of
inheritance
should
lead
to
new
ways
for
management
of
FM##F-including
genetic

and

in
affected
families.

with
anti-fusion

antibodies.
The
Huntington
disease
(HD)
p##hen##otype
is
associated
with
expansion
of
a
t##rin##uc##leo##tide
repeat
in
the
IT##15
gene,
which
is
predicted
to
en##code
a
34##8-k##D##a
protein
named
hunting##ton.
We
used
p##oly##c##lon##al
and
mon##oc##lon##al
anti-fusion
protein
antibodies
to
identify
native
hunting##tin
in
rat,
monkey,
and
human.
Western
b##lot##s
revealed
a
protein
with
the
expected
molecular
weight
which
is
present
in
the
soluble
fraction
of
rat
and
monkey
brain
tissues
and
l##ymph##ob##last##oid
cells
from
control
cases.
In
l##ymph##ob##last##oid
cell
lines
from
juvenile-onset
he##tero##zy##got##e
HD
cases,
both
normal
and
mutant
hunting##tin
are
expressed,
and
increasing
repeat
expansion
leads
to
lower
levels
of
the
mutant
protein.
I##mm##uno##cy##to##chemistry
indicates
that
hunting##tin
is
located
in
neurons
throughout
the
brain,
with
the
highest
levels
evident
in
larger
neurons.
In
the
human
s##tri##at##um,
hunting##tin
is
en##rich##ed
in
a
patch-like
distribution,
potentially
corresponding
to
the
first
areas
affected
in
HD.
Sub##cellular
local##ization
of
hunting##tin
is
consistent
with
a
c##yt##oso##lic
protein
primarily
found
in
so##mat##ode##nd##ritic
regions.
Hunting##tin
appears
to
particularly
associate
with
micro##tub##ules,
although
some
is
also
associated
with
s##yna##ptic
ve##si##cles.
On
the
basis
of
the
local##ization
of
hunting##tin
in
association
with
micro##tub##ules,
we
s##pec##ulate
that
the
mutation
imp##air##s
the
c##yt##os##kel##etal
anchor##ing
or
transport
of
mit##och##ond##ria,
ve##si##cles,

Recently
we
have
isolated
the

which
causes

and
its

in
a
substantial

have
been
identified.
On
the
basis
of
this
information,
we
compared
the
location
of
g##er##m-line

in
the

in
22

with
the

17
were

The

seems
to
co##rrel##ate
with

g##er##m-line

in
five
FA##P

were
observed
between

mutations
in
17
FA##P
patients
with
fewer
p##oly##ps
were
observed
in
the
other

of
the

The
result
suggests
that
the
number
of

in
FA##P

may
be
associated
with
a
difference
in
the

and
mice
with

have
a

similar
to
that
seen
in

The

suggest
a

D##p##26##0,
in

We
have
undertaken
a
systematic
evaluation
of
D##MD/B##MD
patients
through
clinical
examination
and
review
of
the
literature
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
position-specific
effects
of
mutations
noted
in
the
mouse
are
present
in
man.
We
have
found
that,
in
man,
a
wider
variation
of
D##MD
defects
co##rrel##ate
with
reduction##s
in
the
b-wave

Individuals
with
normal
ER##G##s
have
mutations
predominantly
located
5
of
the
trans##cript
initiation
site
of
D##p##26##0.
Our
results
suggest
that
the
most
important
de##ter##mina##nt
in
the
ER##G
b-wave
p##hen##otype
is
the
mutation
position,
rather
than
muscle

Forty-six

as
opposed
to
94%

The

are
consistent
with
a
role
for

Molecular

We
report
here
the
molecular
characterization
of
two
gal##act##ose##mia
mutations,
L##7##4##P

in
human

Both
gal##act##ose##mia
mutations
result
in
reduced
en##zy##matic
activity
when
reconstructed
in
the
c##D##NA
and
over##ex##pressed.
The
p##oly##mor##phism,
in
contrast,
has
near
normal
activity.
Both
mutations
affect
evolution##arily
conserved
residues,
suggesting
that
they
are
functional##ly
important,
while
the
p##oly##mor##phism
occurs
in
a
non##con##serve##d

which
is
presumably
not
critical
for
en##zy##matic
function.
The

is
close
to
the

Our

further
support
the
notion
of
molecular
he##tero##gene##ity
of
gal##act##ose##mia
and
suggest
that
gal##act##ose##mia

may
be
useful
tools
in
highlighting

the

of
the
Ash##ken##azi
Jewish
N##37##0##S
and

acid
beta-g##lu##cos##idas##e
mutations.
Type
1
G##au##cher
disease
(G##D),
a
non-ne##uron##op##ath##ic
l##ys##oso##mal
storage
disorder,
results
from
the
def##icient
activity
of
acid
beta-g##lu##cos##idas##e
(GB##A).
Type
1
disease
is
pan##eth##nic
but
is
more
prevalent
in
individuals
of
Ash##ken##azi
Jewish
(AJ)
descent.
Of
the
ca##usa##tive
GB##A
mutations,
N##37##0##S
is
particularly
frequent
in
the
AJ
population,
(q
approximately.
03),
whereas
the
84##G##G
insertion
(q
approximately.
00##3)
occurs
exclusively
in
the
Ash##ken##azi##m.
To
investigate
the
genetic
history
of
these
mutations
in
the
AJ
population,
short
tandem
repeat
(ST##R)
markers
were
used
to
map
a
9.
3-c##M
region
containing
the
GB##A
lo##cus
and
to
g##eno##type
261
AJ
N##37##0##S
chromosome##s,
60
European
non-Jewish
N##37##0##S
chromosome##s,
and
62
AJ
84##G##G
chromosome##s.
A
highly
conserved
ha##p##lot##ype
at
four
markers
flank##ing
GB##A
(P##K##LR,
D##1##S##15##9##5,
D##1##S##27##21,
and
D##1##S##27##7##7)
was
observed
on
both
the
AJ
chromosome##s
and
the
non-Jewish
N##37##0##S
chromosome##s,
suggesting
the
occurrence
of
a
founder
common
to
both
populations.
Of
note,
the
presence
of
different
diver##gent
ha##p##lot##ype##s
suggested
the
occurrence
of
de
no##vo,
re##current
N##37##0##S
mutations.
In
contrast,
a
different
conserved
ha##p##lot##ype
at
these
markers
was
identified
on
the
84##G##G
chromosome##s,
which
was
unique
to
the
AJ
population.
On
the
basis
of
the
link##age
di##se##qui##li##bri##um
(L##D)
delta
values,
the
non-Jewish
European
N##37##0##S
chromosome##s
had
greater
ha##p##lot##ype
diversity
and
less
L##D
at
the
markers
flank##ing
the
conserved
ha##p##lot##ype
than
did
the
AJ
N##37##0##S
chromosome##s.
This
finding
is
consistent
with
the
presence
of
the
N##37##0##S
mutation
in
the
non-Jewish
European
population
prior
to
the
founding
of
the
AJ
population.
Coal##es##cence
analyses
for
the
N##37##0##S
and
84##G##G
mutations
estimated
similar
coal##es##cence
times,
of
48
and
55.5
generations
ago,
respectively.
The
results
of
these
studies
are
consistent
with
a
significant
bottle##neck
occurring
in
the
AJ
population
during
the
first
millennium,
when
the
population
became
established
in

Investigation

in

syndrome.
A

is
used
to
assess

characteristics
in
children
with

(P##WS)
compared
to
3

(S##IB),
ne##uro##de##vel##op##mental##ly

children
(N##D),
and
age

Sign##ificant
differences
were

between
P##WS

in
the
prevalence
of
f##eb##ril##e

No
differences
were
noted
in
any
variable
between
the
P##WS
patients
and
the
N##D

suggesting
that
these
abnormal##ities
are
not
unique
to
P##WS,
but
can
occur
in
any
ne##uro##de##vel##op##mental##ly

The

lip##op##rote##ins
(HD##L)
were
characterized
in
patients
with
the
genetic
disease
c##ere##bro##tend##ino##us
x##ant##hom##ato##sis
(CT##X).
A##b##nor##mal##ities
in
the
HD##L
may
contribute
to
their
increased
at##her##ogen##esis
and
excessive
deposits
of
tissue
s##tero##ls
in
the
presence
of
low
or
low-normal
concentrations
of
plasma
ch##ole##ster##ol
(165
+/-
25
mg/d##l)
and
low
density
lip##op##rote##ins
(L##D##L).
The
mean
HD##L-ch##ole##ster##ol
concentration
in
the
CT##X
plasma##s
was
14.
5
+/-
3.
2
mg/d##l,
about
one-third
the
normal
value.
The
low
HD##L-ch##ole##ster##ol
reflects
a
low
concentration
and
an
abnormal
lip##id
composition
of
the
plasma
HD##L.
Re##lative
to
normal
HD##L,
the
ch##ole##ster##yl
est##ers
are
low,
free
ch##ole##ster##ol
and
p##hos##ph##oli##pid##s
essentially
normal,
and
t##rig##ly##cer##ides
increased.
The
ratio
of
a##pop##rote##in
(a##po)
to
total
ch##ole##ster##ol
in
the
HD##L
of
CT##X
was
two
to
three
times
greater
than
normal.
In
the
CT##X
HD##L,
the
ratio
of
a##po##A##I
to
a##po##A##II
was
high,
the
proportion
of
a##po##C
low,
and
a
normally
minor
form
of
a##po##A##I
increased
relative
to
other
forms.
The
HD##L
in
electron
micro##graphs
appeared
normal
m##or##phological##ly
and
in
particle
size.
The
abnormal##ities
in
lip##op##rote##in
distribution
profile
and
composition
of
the
plasma
HD##L
result
from
metabolic
defects
that
are
not
understood
but
may
be
linked
to
the
genetic
defect
in
bi##le
acid
synthesis
in
CT##X.
As
a
consequence,
it
is
probable
that
the
normal
functions
of
the
HD##L,
possibly
including
m##od##ulation
of
L##D##L-ch##ole##ster##ol
up##take
and
the
removal
of
excess
ch##ole##ster##ol
from
peripheral
tissues,
are
per##tur##bed
significantly
in
this
disease.

Mu##tations
resulting

(30/62
[48%])
of
a
new
series
of
mutations
in
the
AT##M

in
patients
with

(AT)
that
were
detected
by
the
protein-t##run##cation
ass##ay
followed
by
sequence
analysis
of
g##eno##mic
DNA.
Few##er
than
half
of
the
s##p##licing
mutations
involved
the
canonical
AG
s##p##lice-accept##or
site
or
GT
s##p##lice-donor
site.
A
higher
percentage
of
mutations
occurred
at
less
string##ently
conserved
sites,
including
silent
mutations
of
the
last
n##uc##leo##tide
of
ex##ons,
mutations
in
n##uc##leo##tide##s
other
than
the
conserved
AG
and
GT
in
the
consensus
s##p##lice
sites,
and
creation
of
s##p##lice-accept##or
or
s##p##lice-donor
sites
in
either
intro##ns
or
ex##ons.
These
s##p##licing
mutations
led
to
a
variety
of
consequences,
including
ex##on
skip##ping
and,
to
a
lesser
degree,
intro##n
retention,
activation
of
cry##ptic
s##p##lice
sites,
or
creation
of
new
s##p##lice
sites.
In
addition,
5
of
12
nonsense

and
1
miss##ense
mutation
were
associated
with
del##eti##on
in
the
c##D##NA
of
the

in
which
the

occurred.
No
AT##M

was
detected
by

in
both
normal

and
patients
for
whom
no
underlying

could
be
found
in

were
also
observed,
suggesting
caution
in
the
interpretation
of

molecular

and
in
carrier

Here
we
used
field
in##version
gel
electro##ph##ores##is
(F##IG##E)
to
construct
a
restriction
map
of
approximately
1,
000
k##b
of
DNA
surrounding
the
RB##1
lo##cus
and
to
detect
the
trans##location
break##points
in
three
re##tino##blast##oma
patients.
DNA
probe##s
from
either
the
5
or
3
end
of
the
gene
were
used
to
detect
a
250-k##b
E##ag##I
restriction
fragment
in
DNA
from
un##af##fected
individuals.
Both
probe##s
identified
an
additional
hybrid##izing
fragment
in
the
DNA
from
each
patient,
permitting
the
break##points
in
all
three
to
be
mapped
within
the
clone##d
RB##1
gene.
Analysis
of
the
break##point
in
one
trans##location
cell
line
allowed
the
RB##1
gene
to
be
oriented
with
its
5
end
toward
the
cent##rome##re.
The
5
end
of
the
gene
also
appeared
to
be
associated
with
a
cluster##ing
of
sites
for
several
in##f##re##quent##ly
c##lea##ving

indicating
the

of
all
three

Constitutional
mutations
in
the
W##T##1
gene
in
patients
with
Den##ys-Dr##ash
syndrome.
The
Den##ys-Dr##ash
syndrome
is
characterised
by
a
typical
ne##ph##rop##athy,
g##eni##tal
abnormal##ities
and
also
pre##dis##pose##s
to
the
development
of
W##il##ms
tumor.
These
patients
eventually
go
into
end

A
candidate
W##il##ms
tumor
gene,
W##T##1,
from
the
11##p##13
chromosome
region
has
recently
been
clone##d.
We
have
anal##ys##ed
the
DNA
sequence
in
constitutional
cells
from
eight
patients
and
have
shown
he##tero##zy##go##us
mutations
in
six
of
them.
Four
of
the
mutations
were
in
ex##on

all
resulting
in
miss##ense
mutations.
Three
were
at
n##uc##leo##tide
position
118##0
resulting
in
an

change.
The
other
was
at
position
118##6
converting
an

the
predicted

One
patient
had
a
miss##ense

in
ex##on

converting
an

his.
A
single
base

insertion
at
n##uc##leo##tide
position
82##1
in
ex##on

resulted
in
the
generation
of
a
premature

in
the
last
patient.
We
were
unable
to
find
a
mutation
in
one
patient
despite
complete
se##quencing
of
the
g##eno##mic
sequence
of
the
gene.
The
last
patient
carried
a
constitutional
del##eti##on
of
the
11##p##13
region
and
no
additional
mutation
was
found.
There
was
no
obvious
correlation
between
the
type
of
mutation
and
p##hen##otypic
expression.
These
results
further
demonstrate
that
the
W##T##1
gene
is
important
in
both
the
development
of
the

and
the

were
characterized
by
analysis
of
reverse-trans##cribed,

We
used
SS##CP

on
four

covering
the

of
the

and
detected

for
the
fragment
spanning
all
or

of
ex##ons
13-15
in
three
of
the

in

In
the
other
two

the

were
of

Direct
se##quencing
of

revealed
a

In##tron##ic

Our
results
indicate
that
the
severe
form
of

is
caused
by
multiple
P##EP##D

In

Trans##location

A

were
observed
to
have
an
apparently

trans##location
involving

No
other
clinical
characteristics
often
associated
with
the
del##eti##on
of

were
observed
in
this
family.
This
finding,
in
association
with
3
other
instances
of
single

at
11##p##13
and

supports
the

and
identification
of
a

Direct
se##quencing
of
the
em##eri##n
gene
in
22
families
with
Emery-Dr##ei##fu##ss
muscular
d##ys##tro##phy
(E##MD)
revealed
mutations
in
21
(95%),
confirming
that
em##eri##n
mutations
can
be
identified
in
the
majority
of
families
with
X-linked
E##MD.
Most
em##eri##n
mutations
result
in
absence
of
the
protein.
In
this
study
three
mutations
(a
miss##ense
mutation
Pro##18##3##T##hr
and
two
in-frame
del##eti##ons
removing
residues
95-99
and
236-241,
respectively)
were
unusual
in
being
associated
with
expression
of
mutant
protein.
The
p##hen##otype
in
these
families
was
compared
in
detail
with
the
clinical
features
in
cases
with
typical
null
mutations.
For
the
in-frame
del##eti##ons
there
were
no
significant
differences.
In
the
family
with
the
miss##ense
mutation
the
p##hen##otype
was
mild##er.
Age
at
onset
was
later
for
first
symptoms
and
for
development
of
ankle
contract##ures
and
muscle
weakness.
These
findings
have
diagnostic
implications
as
well
as
pointing
to
functional##ly
important

Here
the

These

suggest
that
the

may
regulate

(k##b).
To
study
how
mutations
in
this
gene
affect
muscle
development
and
integrity,
it
would
be
of
interest
to
have
available
a
mouse
model
of
the
human
disease.
The
mouse
m##d##x
mutation
affects
muscle
and
con##fers
a
mild
d##ys##tro##phic
syndrome,
but
it
is
not
clear
whether
this
mutation
is
equivalent
to
Du##chen##ne/Becker
muscular
d##ys##tro##phy
in
man.
Here
we
describe
the
use
of
two
sequences
from
the
human
Du##chen##ne
muscular
d##ys##tro##phy
(D##MD)
gene
that
cross-hybrid##ize
to
mouse
X-linked
sequences
to
local##ize
the
gene
ho##mo##log##ous
to
D##MD
in
the
mouse.
Both
sequences
map
to
the
region
of
10

lying
between
the

St##14-1
(D##x##P##as##8)

close
to
the

(Ph##k).
By
analogy
with
the
human
X-chromosome,
we
conclude
that
the
region
in
the
mouse
around
the
G##6##p##d

may
contain
two
genes
corresponding

detected
(Kelly

Clinical

and
transferred
into

The

demonstrating
that
a

support
the

Recently,
mutations
in
the

Because

A

occurs
in
about
1

and
is
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of

and

in

We
have
now
used
DNA
p##oly##mor##phism##s
associated
with
the
AA##T
gene
to
investigate
the
origin
of
the
P##I
Z
all##ele.
Using
two
g##eno##mic
probe##s
extending
into
the
5
and

respectively,
we
have
identified
eight
p##oly##morphic

Ex##tensive

occurs
throughout
the

region
with
the

but
not

My##oto##nic
d##ys##tro##phy
in
trans##genic

expressing
an

repeat.
My##oto##nic
d##ys##tro##phy
(D##M),
the
most
common
form
of
muscular
d##ys##tro##phy
in
adult
humans,
results
from
expansion
of
a
CT##G
repeat
in
the
3
un##tra##ns##lated
region
of
the
D##MP##K
gene.
The
mutant
D##MP##K
messenger
RNA
(m##RNA)
contains
an
expanded
C##U##G
repeat
and
is
retained
in
the
nucleus.
We
have
expressed
an
un##tra##ns##lated
C##U##G
repeat
in
an
unrelated
m##RNA
in
trans##genic
mice.
Mi##ce
that
expressed
expanded
C##U##G
repeats
developed
my##oto##nia
and
my##op##athy,
whereas
mice
expressing
a
none##x##pan##ded
repeat
did
not.
Thus,
trans##cripts
with
expanded
C##U##G
repeats
are
sufficient
to
generate
a
D##M
p##hen##otype.
This
result
supports
a
role
for

The
P##rade##r-Will##i

(P##WS)
critical

on
15##q##11-q##13
is
subject
to
imprint##ing.
P##WS
becomes
apparent
when
genes
on
the

are
not
expressed.
F##ami##lial
P##WS
is
rare.
We
report
on
a

in
which
a
male

a
female

both
have
P##WS
with
c##yt##ogen##etic##ally

the

GA##BR##B##3.
The

The

of
the

and
their

is
not

is
at
risk
of
having
affected
grandchildren
through

In
this
case,
P##WS
does
not
become
evident
as
long
as
the

is
passed
through
the

This
represents
a
unique

due
to

suggest
a

in
P##rade##r-will##i

and
the

P##rade##r-Will##i

(P##WS)
is
caused
by
the
loss
of

of

in

N##ec##din,
a
protein
implicated
in
the
terminal
differentiation
of
neurons,
is
the
only
P##WS
candidate
gene
to
reduce
via##bility
when
disrupted
in
a
mouse
model.
In
this
study,
we
have
characterized
MA##GE##L##2
(also
known
as
N##D##NL##1),
a
gene
with
51%
amino
acid
sequence
similarity
to
ne##c##din
and
located
41
k##b
di##stal
to
N##D##N
in
the
P##WS
del##eti##on
region.
MA##GE##L##2
is
expressed
predominantly
in
brain,
the
primary
tissue
affected
in
P##WS
and
in
several
f##etal
tissues
as
shown
by
northern
b##lot
analysis.
MA##GE##L##2
is
imprint##ed
with
mon##oa##lle##lic

brain,
and
paternal-only
expression
in
the
central
nervous

as
demonstrated
by
its
lack
of

in
brain
from
a
P##WS-affected
individual.
The
or##th##olo##go##us
mouse
gene
(Ma##gel##2)
is
located
within
150
k##b
of
N##D##N
,
is

and
is

We
h##y##pot##hes##ize
that,
although
loss
of
ne##c##din

may
be
important
in
the

A
single
origin
of
p##hen##yl##ket##on##uria
in
Yemen##ite
Jews.
Ph##en##yl##ket##on##uria
(P##K##U)
is
a
metabolic
disease
caused
by
re##cess##ive
mutations
of
the
gene
encoding
the
he##pa##tic
enzyme
p##hen##yla##lani##ne
h##ydro##xy##lase
(PA##H).
The
incidence
of
P##K##U
varies
widely
across
different
geographic
areas,
and
is
highest
(about
1
in
5,
000
live
births)
in
Ireland
and
western
Scotland,
and
among
Yemen##ite
Jews.
A
limited
number
of
point
mutations
account
for
most
of
the
P##K##U
cases
in
the
European
population.
Here
we
report
that
a
single
molecular
defect--a
del##eti##on
spanning
the
third
ex##on
of
the
PA##H
gene--is
responsible
for
all
the
P##K##U
cases
among
the
Yemen##ite
Jews.
Examination
of
a
random
sample
of
Yemen##ite
Jews
using
a
molecular
probe
that
detect##s
the
carriers
of
this
del##eti##on
indicated
a
high
frequency
of
the
defect##ive
gene
in
this
community.
Although
the
deleted
PA##H
gene
was
traced
to
25
different
locations
throughout
Yemen,
family
histories
and
official
documents
of
the
Yemen##ite
Jewish
community
showed
that
the
common
ancestor
of
all
the
carriers
of
this
genetic
defect
lived
in
San##a,
the
capital
of
Yemen,
before
the
eighteenth
century..
High
resolution
genetic
analysis
suggests
one
ancestral
pre##dis##po##sing
ha##p##lot##ype
for
the
origin
of
the
my##oto##nic
d##ys##tro##phy
mutation.
The
mutation
causing
my##oto##nic
d##ys##tro##phy
(D##M)
has
been
identified
as
an
am##p##lification
of
an
unstable
t##rin##uc##leo##tide
(CT##G)
n
repeat
in
over
99%
of
the
global
D##M
population.
It
is
in
complete
link##age
di##se##qui##li##bri##um
with
an
Al##u
element
p##oly##mor##phism
within
the
D##M
kinase
gene,
suggesting
that
D##M
is
a
consequence
of
one
or
few
ancestral
mutations.
A
recent
analysis
utilizing
this
p##oly##mor##phism
as
well
as
a
flank##ing
din##uc##leo##tide
marker,
suggested
that
similar
to
Fr##agi##le
X
syndrome,
D##M
exhibited
a
founder
effect
(I##mber##t
et
al.,
1993
Nature
Gene##t.
4,
72-76).
In
contrast,
the
low
reproductive
fitness
of
individuals
with
con##gen##ital
D##M
(the
end##point
of
genetic
anticipation
in
my##oto##nic
d##ys##tro##phy)
suggests
a
higher
rate
of
new
mutations.
We
present
a
high
resolution
genetic
analysis
of
the
D##M
lo##cus
using
PC##R
based
ass##ays
of
nine
p##oly##mor##phism##s,
spanning
a
physical
distance
of
30
k##b,
within
and
immediately
flank##ing
the
D##M
kinase
gene.
The
persistent
complete
all##eli##c
association
of
the
D##M
mutation
with
all
these
p##oly##mor##phism##s
provides
further
support
to
previous
observations
and
suggests
more
strongly
that
the
D##M
mutation
occurred
on
the
background
of
a
particular
ha##p##lot##ype
in
which
the
(CT##G)
n
repeat
became
inherent##ly
unstable
and
therefore
pre##dis##posed
to
am##p##lification.
I##dent##ification

of
three
Ta##y-Sachs
mutations
in
the
Moroccan
Jewish

In##fant##ile
Ta##y-Sachs
disease
(T##SD)
is
caused
by
mutations
in
the
H##EX##A
gene
that
result
in
the
complete
absence
of
beta-he##x##osa##mini##das##e
A
activity.
It
is
well
known
that
an
elevated
frequency
of
T##SD
mutations
exists
among
Ash##ken##azi
Jews.
More
recently
it
has
become
apparent
that
elevated
carrier
frequencies
for
T##SD
also
occur
in
several
other
ethnic
groups,
including
Moroccan
Jews,
a
subgroup
of
Sep##hard##ic
Jews.
El##se##where
we
reported
an
in-frame
del##eti##on
of
one
of
the
two
adjacent
p##hen##yla##lani##ne
co##don##s
at
position
304
or
305
(delta
F##30##4/305)
in
one
H##EX##A
all##ele
of
a
Moroccan
Jewish
T##SD
patient
and
in
three
o##b##liga##te
carriers
from
six
unrelated
Moroccan
Jewish
families.
We
have
now
identified
two
additional
mutations
within
ex##on
5
of
the
H##EX##A
gene
that
account
for
the
remaining
T##SD
all##ele##s
in
the
patient
and
carriers.
One
of
the
mutations
is
a
novel
C-to-G
trans##version,
resulting
in
a
replacement
of
Ty##r##18##0
by
a
stop
co##don.
The
other
mutation
is
a
G-to-A
transition
resulting
in
an
A##rg##17##0-to-G##ln
substitution.
This
mutation
is
at
a
C##p##G
site
in
a
Japanese
infant
with
Ta##y-Sachs
disease
and
was
described
elsewhere.
Analysis
of
nine
o##b##liga##te
carriers
from
seven
unrelated
families
showed
that
four
harbor
the
delta
F##30##4/305
mutation,
two
the
A##rg##17##0----G##ln
mutation,
and
one
the
Ty##r##18##0----Stop
mutation.
We
also
have
developed
rapid,
non##rad##io##active
ass##ays
for
the
detection
of
each
mutation,
which
should
be
helpful
for
carrier
screening..
Map##ping

ATP##7##B,
the

(W##D)
patients,
lies
in
a
block
of
ho##mology
shared
between
human
chromosome
13##q##14
and
the
central

of
mouse

However,
we
have
mapped
the
m##uri##ne
ho##mo##logue
of
ATP##7##B
(At##p##7##b)
to
mouse
chromosome
8
by
so##matic

Analysis
of
80
inter##sp##ec##ific

was
used
to
position
At##p##7##b
close
to
D##8##M##it##3
and
another

lo##cus,
At##p##4##b,
on

ATP##4##B
lies
in
13##q##34
and
is
separated
from
ATP##7##B
by
several
lo##ci
whose
mouse

map
to
mouse

The

identifies
a
previously
un##re##co##gni##zed
region
of

between
this

This

suggests
a

Character##istic##s

of

in

In
my##oto##nic
d##ys##tro##phy
(D##M),
the
size
of
a
CT##G
repeat
in
the
D##M
kinase
gene
generally
increases
in
successive
generations
with
clinical
evidence
of
anticipation.
However,
there
have
also
been
cases
with
an
inter##gene##ration##al
contraction
of
the
repeat.
We
examined
1,
48##9
D##M
parent-offspring
pairs,
of
which
95
(6.
4%)
showed
such
contraction##s
in
peripheral
blood
le##uk##ocytes
(P##BL).
In
56
of
the
95
pairs,
clinical
data
allowed
an
analysis
of
their
anticipation
status.
It
is
surprising
that
anticipation
occurred
in
27
(48%)
of
these
56
pairs,
while
none
clearly
showed
a
later
onset
of
D##M
in
the
s##ym##pt##oma##tic
offspring.
The
contraction
occurred
in
76
(10%)
of
75##3
paternal
transmissions
and
in
19
(3%)
of
73##6
maternal
transmissions.
Anti##ci##pation
was
observed
more
frequently
in
maternal
(85%)
than
in
paternal
(37%)
transmissions
(P
<.
00##1).
The
parental
repeat
size
correlated
with
the
size
of
inter##gene##ration##al
contraction
(r##2
=.
50,
P
<
<.
00##1),
and
the
slope
of
linear
re##gression
was
steep##er
in
paternal
(-.
62)
than
in
maternal
(-.
30)
transmissions
(P
<
<.
00##1).
Sixteen
D##M
parents
had
multiple
D##M
offspring
with
the
CT##G
repeat
contraction##s.
This
frequency
was
higher
than
the
frequency
expected
from
the
probability
of
the
repeat
contraction##s
(6.
4%)
and
the
size
of
D##M
si##b
population
(1.
54
D##M
offspring
per
D##M
parent,
in
96##8
D##M
parents).
We
conclude
that
(1)
inter##gene##ration##al
contraction##s
of
the
CT##G
repeat
in
le##uk##oc##yte
DNA
frequently
a##cco##mp##ani##es
apparent

especially
when

and
(2)
the

This

may
account
for

The
disease
gene
(PD##S)
has
been
mapped
to
chromosome
7##q##22-q##31,
and
en##codes
a

We
performed

(two

We
identified
a

mutation
affecting
intro##n
4
of
the

gene,
at
n##uc##leo##tide
position
63##9

RNA
analysis
from
l##ymph##ocytes
of
the

showed
that
mutation
63##9

generates
a

leading
to
an
m##RNA
with
an

Since
the

is
likely
to
compete
with

variations
of
the
levels
of

a##ber##rant
trans##cripts
of

The

There
are
three
mechanisms
by
which
CT##G
expansion
can
result
in
D##M.
First,
repeat
expansion
may
alter
the

consequently
reduce

Third,
toxic
effects
of
the

may
be
intrinsic
to
the
repeated
elements
at
the

of
DNA
or

(re##fs

Previous
studies
have
demonstrated
that
a
dose-dependent
loss
of
D##m##15
(the
mouse
D##MP##K
ho##mo##logue)
in
mice
produces
a
partial
D##M
p##hen##otype
characterized
by
decreased
development
of
skeletal
muscle
force
and
cardiac
conduct##ion
disorders.
To
test
the
role
of
Six##5
loss
in
D##M,
we
have
anal##ys##ed
a
strain
of
mice
in
which
Six##5
was
deleted.
Our
results
demonstrate
that
the
rate
and
severity
of
cat##ara##ct
formation
is
inverse##ly
related
to
Six##5
dos##age
and
is
temporal##ly
progressive.
Six##5
+/-
and
Six##5-/-
mice
show
increased
steady-state
levels
of
the
Na
+/K
+
-ATP##ase
alpha-1
subunit
and
decreased
D##m##15
m##RNA
levels.
Thus,
altered
ion
home##ost##asis
within
the
lens
may
contribute
to
cat##ara##ct
formation.
As
o##cular
cat##ara##cts
are
a
characteristic
feature
of
D##M,
these
results
demonstrate
that
decreased
S##IX##5
transcription
is
important
in
the
a##eti##ology
of
D##M.
Our
data
support
the
hypothesis
that
D##M
is
a
con##ti##guous
gene

associated
with
the
partial
loss
of
both
D##MP##K
and
S##IX##5..
C##is
and
trans
effects
of
the
my##oto##nic
d##ys##tro##phy
(D##M)
mutation
in
a
cell
culture
model.
The
mutation
causing
my##oto##nic
d##ys##tro##phy
(D##M)
has
been
identified
as
a
CT##G
expansion
in
the
3-un##tra##ns##lated
region
(3-U##TR)
of
the
D##M
protein
kinase
gene
(D##MP##K),
but
the
mechanism
(s)
of
path##ogen##esis
remain
unknown.
Studies
using
D##M
patient
materials
have
often
produced
confusing
results.
Therefore,
to
study
the
effects
of
the
D##M
mutation
in
a
controlled
environment,
we
have
established
a
cell
culture
model
system
using
C##2##C##12
mouse
my##ob##last##s.
By
expressing
ch##ime##ric
reporter
construct##s
containing
a
reporter
gene
fused
to
a
human
D##MP##K
3-U##TR,
we
identified
both
c##is
and
trans
effects
that
are
mediated
by
the
D##M
mutation.
Our
data
show
that
a
mutant
D##MP##K
3-U##TR,
with
as
few
as
57
CT##G##s,
had
a
negative
c##is
effect
on
protein
expression
and
resulted
in
the
a##gg##regation
of
reporter
trans##cripts
into
discrete
nuclear
f##oc##i.
We
determined
by
del##eti##on
analysis
that
an
expanded
(CT##G)
(n)
tract
alone
was
sufficient
to
media##te
these
c##is
effects.
Furthermore,
in
contrast
to
the
normal
D##MP##K
3-U##TR
m##RNA,
a
mutant
D##MP##K
3-U##TR
m##RNA
with
(C##U##G)
(200)
selective##ly
in##hibit##ed
my##ogenic
differentiation
of
C##2##C##12
my##ob##last##s.
Gene##tic
analysis
and
the
C##re-
lo##x##P
system
were
used
to
clearly
demonstrate
that
the
my##ob##last
fusion
defect
could
be
rescued
by
eliminating
the
expression
of
the
mutant
D##MP##K
3-U##TR
trans##cript.
Character##ization
of
spontaneous
del##eti##on
events
mapped
the
inhibitor##y
effect
to
the
(CT##G)
(n)
expansion
and/or
the
3
end
of
the
D##MP##K
3-U##TR.
These
results
provide
evidence
that
the
D##M
mutation
acts
in
c##is
to
reduce
protein
production
(consistent
with
D##MP##K
ha##p##lo##ins##uff##iciency)
and

the

The

difference
in
both

Mu##tations
were

of
RB##1
in
both

In
one

a

converts
an

(C##G##G)
to
a

In
this
family,
incomplete
pen##et##rance
and
mild
p##hen##otypic

were
observed
in
virtually
all
patients,
possibly
indicating
that
single
amino

may
modify
protein

such
that
tumor##ige##nes##is

In

is
a

A

altered
in

has
been

However,
since
this
original

on
identification
of
a

F##G##D##1
gene
in
an
AA##S
patient,
no
additional
mutations
in
the
F##G##D##1
gene
have
been
described.
We
anal##ys##ed
13
independent
patients
with
clinical
diagnosis
of
AA##S.
One
patient
presented
a
mutation
that
results
in
a
n##uc##leo##tide
change
in
ex##on
10
of
the
F##G##D##1
gene
(G##25##5##9

sub##stituting
a

to
se##g##re##gate
with
the
AA##S
p##hen##otype
in
affected
males
and
carrier
females
in
the
family
of
this

Interest##ingly,
A##rg-610
is
located
within
one
of
the
two
p##le##cks##tri##n
ho##mology
(P##H)
domains
of
the
F##G##D##1
gene
and
it
corresponds
to
a
highly
conserved
residue
which
has
been
involved
in
In##s##P
binding
in
P##H
domains
of
other
proteins.
The

residue
is
often

gene
in
patients
with
an
X-linked

The
A##rg##6##10##G##ln
mutation
represents
the
first
case
of
a
mutation
in
the
P##H
domain
of
the
F##G##D##1

and
additional
evidence
that
mutations
in

can
be

the

Non##in##vasive

analysis.
I##dent##ification
of
the
FM##R##1
gene
and
the
repeat-am##p##lification
mechanism
causing
fragile
X
syndrome
led
to
development
of
reliable
DNA-based
diagnostic
methods,
including
Southern
b##lot
hybrid##ization
and
PC##R.
Both
methods
are
performed
on
DNA
isolated
from
peripheral
blood
cells
and
measure
the
repeat
size
in
FM##R##1.
Using
an
im##mu##no##cy##to##chemical
technique
on
blood
s##me##ars,
we
recently
developed
a
novel
test
for
identification
of
patients
with
fragile
X
syndrome.
This
method,
also
called
"
anti##body
test,
"
uses
mon##oc##lon##al
antibodies
against
the
FM##R##1
gene
product
(FM##RP)
and
is
based
on
absence
of
FM##RP
in
patients
cells.
Here
we
describe
a
new
diagnostic
test
to
identify
male
patients
with
fragile
X
syndrome,
on
the
basis
of
lack
of
FM##RP
in
their
hair
roots.
Express##ion
of
FM##RP
in
hair
roots
was
studied
by
use
of
an
FM##RP-specific
anti##body
test,
and
the
percentage
of
FM##RP-expressing
hair
roots
in
controls
and
in
male
fragile
X
patients
was
determined.
Control
individuals
showed
clear
expression
of
FM##RP
in
nearly
every
hair
root,
whereas
male
fragile
X
patients
lacked
expression
of
FM##RP
in
almost
all
their
hair
roots.
Mental##ly
re##tar##ded
female
patients
with
a
full
mutation
showed
FM##RP
expression
in
only
some
of
their
hair
roots
(<
55%),
and
no
overlap
with
normal
female
controls
was
observed.
The
advantages
of
this
test
are
(1)
p##luck##ing
of
hair
f##oll##icles
does
no
app##re##cia##ble
harm
to
the
mentally
re##tar##ded
patient,
(2)
hairs
can
be
sent
in
a
simple
envelope
to
a
diagnostic
center,
and
(3)
the
result
of
the
test
is
available
within
5
h
of
p##luck##ing.
In
addition,
this
test
enabled
us
to
identify
two
fragile
X
patients
who
did
not
show
the
full
mutation
by
analysis
of
DNA
isolated
from

RF##LP
analysis
using
the

(SS##CP)
analysis
of
a
variant
in
ex##on

of
the
P##LP
gene.
The
f##etus
was
predicted
to
be
un##af##fected.
Se##quencing
of
the
ex##on
from
the
C##VS,
the
predicted-carrier
mother,
and
the
o##b##liga##te-carrier
grandmother
revealed
an
A-to-C
change
at
n##uc##leo##tide
54##1
in
the
two
women
but
not
in
the
f##etus.
As
this
change
results
in
a
T##hr-to-Pro
change
at
amino
acid
181
in
a
region
of
the
gene
predicted
to
be
part
of
a
trans##me##mb##rane
segment,
it
was
concluded
that
this
was
the
mutation
causing
the
disease
in
this
family.
In
addition,
in
a
second
family,
an
ex##on
5
variant
band
pattern
on
SS##CP
analysis
was
shown
by
se##quencing
to
be
due
to
a
T-to-C

66##8.
This
results
in
a
Le##u-to-Pro
change
in
a
carrier
mother
and
in
her
two
affected
sons.
These
results
provide
further

of

Mu##tations
in
the

that
en##codes
type

(CO##L##2##A##1),
the
predominant
protein
of

have
been
identified
in
a
number
of
individuals
with
K##nies##t

All
but
two
of
these
previously

mutations
cause
in-frame

in
type

co##lla##gen,
either
by
small

in
the

or
s##p##lice

Furthermore,
all

one
of
these
mutations
is
located
between
ex##ons
12
and
24
in
the
CO##L##2##A##1

We
used

to

in
five
individuals
with
K##nies##t

Se##quencing

identified
four

that

and
4-b##p
del##eti##ons
in
the

A

del##eting
the

was
identified
in
the

The

are
predicted
to
result
in
ex##on

in
the

These

suggest
that
K##nies##t

results
from
shorter

and
support
the

that
alter##ation
of
a
specific

resulting
from

We
present
the
clinical
and
laboratory
findings
in
an
institutional##ised
adult
patient
originally
referred
for
autism.
A
high
risk
of
color##ec##tal

was
predicted
when
an
inter##st##iti##al
del##eti##on
of
the
long
arm
of
chromosome

del

(q##15##q##22.

was
detected
in
her
l##ymph##ocytes
and
del##eti##on
of
the
MCC
and
AP##C
genes
confirmed
by
molecular
analysis.
Aden##oma##to##us
p##oly##po##sis

and
car##cin##oma
of
the
re##ct##um
were
subsequently
diagnosed
in
the
patient.
She
was
profound##ly
mentally
re##tar##ded,
au##tist##ic,
and
had
minor
d##ys##morphic
features
consistent
with
those
of
previous
patients
with
similar
del##eti##ons.
The
del##eti##on
arose
as
a
result
of
re##comb##ination
within
the
small
insertion
loop
formed
at
me##ios##is
by
the

This
family
further
confirms
the
c##yt##ogen##etic
mapping
of
both
MCC
and
AP##C
genes
to
5##q##22
and
comparison
with
other
recent
cases
suggests
that
both
genes
and
their
closely

markers
lie
within
the

sub##band
So##matic
mutations
of
the
AP##C
gene
in
color##ec##tal
tumors:
mutation
cluster
region
in
the
AP##C
gene.
We
examined
so##matic
mutations
of
the
ad##eno##mat##ous
p##oly##po##sis
co##li
(AP##C)
gene
in
63
color##ec##tal
tumors
(16
ad##eno##mas
and
47
car##cin##oma##s)
developed
in
f##ami##lial
ad##eno##mat##ous
p##oly##po##sis
(FA##P)
and
non-FA##P
patients.
In
addition
to
loss
of
he##tero##zy##gos##ity
(L##OH)
at
the
AP##C
lo##cus
in
30
tumors,
43
other
so##matic
mutations
were
detected.
Twenty-one
of
them
were
point
mutations;
16
nonsense
and
two
miss##ense
mutations,
and
three
occurred
in
intro##ns
at
the
s##p##licing
site.
Twenty-two
tumors
had
frames##hi##ft
mutations
due
to
del##eti##on
or
insertion;
nineteen
of
them
were
del##eti##ons
of
one
to
31
b##p
and
three
were
a
1-b##p
insertion.
One
tumor
had
a
1-b##p
del##eti##on
in
an
intro##n
near
the
s##p##licing
site.
Hence,
41
(95%)
of
43
mutations
resulted
in
t##run##cation
of
the
AP##C
protein.
Over
60%
of
the
so##matic
mutations
in
the
AP##C
gene
were
cluster##ed
within
a
small
region
of
ex##on
15,
designated
as
MC##R
(mutation
cluster
region),
which
accounted
for
less
than
10%
of
the
coding
region.
Co##mb##ining
these
data
and
the
results
of
L##OH,
more
than
80%
of
tumors
(14
ad##eno##mas
and
39
car##cin##oma##s)
had
at
least
one
mutation
in
the
AP##C
gene,
of
which
more
than
60%
(9
ad##eno##mas
and
23
car##cin##oma##s)
had
two
mutations.
These
results
strongly
suggest
that
so##matic
mutations
of
the
AP##C
gene
are
associated
with
development
of
a
great
majority
of
color##ec##tal
tumors..
I##dent##ification
of

in
Ash##ken##azi
Ta##y-Sachs

Ta##y-Sachs
disease
is
an
auto##so##mal

genetic
disorder
resulting
from
mutation
of
the

A
relatively

(1/27)
of
a
lethal,
infant##ile
form
of
the
disease
is
found
in
the
Ash##ken##azi
Jewish
population,
but
it
is
not
yet
evident
whether
this
has
resulted
from
a
founder
effect
and
random
genetic
drift
or
from
a
selective

of
he##tero##zy##got##es.
We
have
identified
a
single-base
mutation
in
a
clone##d
fragment
of
the
H##EX##A
gene
from
an
Ash##ken##azi
Jewish
patient.
This
change,
the
substitution
of
a
C
for
G
in
the
first
n##uc##leo##tide
of

is
expected
to
result
in

are
he##tero##zy##go##us

Co##ats'

of
the

caused
by
so##matic
mutation
in
the
NDP
gene:
a
role
for
nor##rin
in
re##tina##l
an##gio##genesis.
Co##ats
disease
is
characterized
by
abnormal
re##tina##l
vascular
development
(so-called
re##tina##l
te##lang##ie##ct##asis)
which
results
in
massive
in##trar##eti##nal
and
sub##ret##inal
lip##id
accumulation
(ex##uda##tive
re##tina##l
detachment).
The
classical
form
of
Co##ats
disease
is
almost
in##var##iably
isolated,
un##ila##teral
and
seen
in
males.
A
female
with
a
un##ila##teral
variant
of
Co##ats
disease
gave
birth
to
a
son
affected
by
Nor##rie
disease.
Both
carried
a
miss##ense
mutation
within
the
NDP
gene
on

Subsequently
analysis
of
the
re##tina##s
of
nine
en##uc##lea##ted
eyes
from
males
with
Co##ats
disease
demonstrated
in
one
a
so##matic
mutation
in
the
NDP
gene
which
was
not
present
within
non-re##tina##l
tissue.
We
suggest
that
Co##ats
te##lang##ie##ct##asis
is
secondary
to
so##matic
mutation
in
the
NDP
gene
which
results
in
a
deficiency
of
nor##rin
(the
protein
product
of
the
NDP
gene)
within
the
developing
re##tina.
This
supports
recent
observations
that
the
protein
is
critical
for
normal
re##tina##l
v##as##cu##log##ene##sis.

and
shown
to

We
have
developed
a

alterations
in
g##eno##mic
DNA
and
have
identified
a
spectrum
of
novel

in
12
additional
unrelated
families.
These
miss##ense,
nonsense
and
frames##hi##ft
mutations
involve
eight
of
the
12
ex##ons
of
the
gene.
Two
mutations
creating

were
associated
with

were
found
in
patients
with

and
no

indicating
that
the
WA##SP

is
the
site
for

in
X-linked

as
well
as
in
WA##S.
A

are
essential
for

We
report
the

of
a

The

introduces
a

of

It
is
predicted
to
cause
a

In

No

The

place
T##CD

This
agrees
with
the
data
obtained
from
other

and
from
physical

All
the
T##CD

studied
have
the

In

D##X##S##7##2,
D##X##Y##S##1,

The

ha##p##lot##ype
is
seen
in
only
15/99
chromosome##s
not
carrying
T##CD.
Moreover,
in
71/104

the

is
different
from
those
seen
in
any

This
supports
the

of
152##4
school##boy##s
from
the
province
of
Mat##era
(Lucan##ia)
in
southern
Italy.
We
have
identified
43
subjects
with
a
G##6##PD
variant.
Of
these,
31
had
severe
G##6##PD
deficiency,
nine
had
mild
to
moderate
deficiency,
and
three
had
a
non-def##icient
electro##ph##ore##tic
variant.
The
overall
rate
of
G##6##PD
deficiency
was
2.
6%.
The
frequency
of
G##6##PD
deficiency,
ranging
from
7.
2%
on
the
Ion##ian
Coast
to
zero
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
Lucan##ian
A##pen##nine##s,
appears
to
be
inverse##ly
related
to
the
distance
of
each
town
examined
from
the
Ion##ian
Coast,
suggesting
that
this
geographic
distribution
may
reflect,
at
least
in
part,
gene
flow
from
Greek
settlers.
B##io##chemical
characterization
has
shown
that
most
of
the
G##6##PD
deficiency
in
this
population
is
accounted
for
by
G##6##PD
Mediterranean.
In
addition,
we
have
found
several
examples
of
two
other
known
p##oly##morphic
variants
(G##6##PD
C##ag##lia##ri
and
G##6##PD
A-);
three

G##6##PD
Mont##al##ban##o
(class

and
two
s##poradic
variants,
G##6##PD
Tu##rs##i
(class

and
G##6##PD
Fe##rra##ndi##na
(class

These

provide
further
evidence
for
the
marked
genetic
he##tero##gene##ity
of
G##6##PD

within
a
relatively
narrow
geographic

they
prove

Cy##to##to##xi##c
T
l##ymph##oc##yte-associated
anti##gen
4
(CT##LA-4,
also
known
as
CD##15##2)
has
been
shown
to
play
a
major
role
in
the
regulation
of
T
cell
activation.
Its
membrane
expression
is
highly
regulated
by
end##oc##yt##osis
and
trafficking
through
the
secret##ory
l##ys##oso##me
pathway.
Ch##edia##k-Hi##gas##hi
syndrome
(CH##S)
is
an
inherited
disorder
caused
by
mutations
in
the
l##ys##oso##mal
trafficking
regulator
gene,
L##Y##ST.
It
results
in
defect##ive
membrane
targeting
of
the
proteins
present
in
secret##ory
l##ys##oso##mes,
and
it
is
associated
with
a
variety
of
features,
including
a
l##ymph##op##rol##ifer##ative
syndrome
with
hem##op##ha##go##cy##tosis.
The
m##uri##ne
equivalent
of
CH##S,
be##ige
mice,
present
similar
characteristics
but
do
not
develop
the
l##ymph##op##rol##ifer##ative
syndrome.
We
show
here##in
that
CT##LA-4
is
present
in
enlarged,
abnormal
ve##si##cles
in
CH##S
T
cells
and
is
not
properly
expressed
at
the
cell
surface
after
T
cell
activation,
whereas
its
surface
expression
is
not
impaired.
It
is
therefore
proposed
that
the
defect##ive
surface
expression
of
CT##LA-4
by
CH##S
T
cells
is
involved
in
the
generation
of
l##ymph##op##rol##ifer##ative
disease.
This
observation
may
provide
insight
into
the
role
of
CT##LA-4
in
humans..

In

suggest
that

suppress##or
may
be
involved
in

is
the

in
s##poradic
cases
of

types
that
are

we
observed
increased
beta-cat##eni##n
levels
in
the

Se##quencing

of

(CT##N##N##B##1)
revealed
an

Our

indicate
for
the
first
time
that
beta-cat##eni##n

may
play
a
role
in
the
development
of

rare
genetic
disorder
associated
with
immune
deficiency,
chromosome
instability,
and
a
pre##dis##position
to
l##ymph##oid
ma##li##gna##ncy.
We
have
detected
ch##rom##oso##mal##ly
an##oma##lous
clone##s
of
l##ymph##ocytes
in
eight
patients
with
this
disorder.
Ch##rom##oso##me
band##ing
disclosed
that
the
clone##s
are
consistently
marked
by
structural
rear##rang##ement
of
the
long
arm
(q)
of
chromosome
14.
A
trans##location
involving
14##q
was
found
in
clone##s
obtained
from
seven
of
the
eight
patients
whereas
a
ring

was
found
in
a

obtained
from
the
other.
These
findings
as
well
as
data
obtained
by
others
for
patients
with
at##ax##ia-te##lang##ie##ct##asi##a
suggest
that
structural
rear##rang##ement
of
14##q
is
the
initial
ch##rom##oso##mal
change
in
l##ymph##oc##yte
clone##s
of
patients
with
this
disorder.
Ch##rom##oso##mes
of
l##ymph##ocytes
from
one
of
the
patients
were
studied
before
and
after
the
onset
of
chronic
l##ymph##oc##ytic
le##uke##mia.
Before
le##uke##mia
was
diagnosed,
the
patient
had
a
l##ymph##oc##yte
clone
with
a
14##q
trans##location.
This
clone
appears
to
have
given
rise
to
the
le##uke##mic

We
h##y##pot##hes##ize
that
structural
rear##rang##ement
of
14##q
is
directly
related
to
abnormal
growth
of
l##ymph##ocytes

that
it
may

The

responsible
for
most
p##hen##yl##ket##on##uria
(P##K##U)
and
h##yper##phe##ny##lal##ani##ne##mia
(HP##A)
cases
are
located
in
the
p##hen##yla##lani##ne
h##ydro##xy##lase
(PA##H)
gene.
Approximately
50-60
mutations
have
been
reported
in
Caucasian##s
and
are
reflected
in
a
wide
range
of
clinical
se##ver##ities.
Most
mutations
are
linked
to
specific
ha##p##lot##ype##s,
as
defined
by
eight
p##oly##morphic
restriction
sites
in
the
PA##H
gene.
We
h##y##pot##hes##ized
that
there
is
at
least
one
mild
mutation
linked
to
ha##p##lot##ype
12
in
the
Swedish
P##K##U/HP##A
population,
since
7
of
8
patients
carrying
ha##p##lot##ype

had
mild
HP##A.
Se##quence
analysis
revealed
a
C-to-G
trans##version
at
the
second
base
of
co##don

resulting
in
a
substitution
of
g##ly##cine
for
al##ani##ne,
in
four
mutant
ha##p##lot##ype
12
genes,
and
a
G-to-A
transition
at
the
second
base
of
co##don
40##8,
resulting
in
a
substitution
of
g##lut##amine
for
a##rg##ini##ne,
in
another
three
mutant
ha##p##lot##ype
12
genes.
These
mutations
segregated
with
mutant
ha##p##lot##ype
12
all##ele##s
in
nuclear
families
but
were
not
present
on
normal
or
other
mutant
all##ele##s.
Both
mutations
were
tested
in
a
e##uka##ryo##tic
expression
system
in
which
enzyme
activities
of
different
mutant
PA##H
enzymes
reflect
the
relative
se##ver##ities
of
the
mutations,
although
these
in
v##it##ro
activities
cannot
be
translated
directly
into
in

The

PA##H
had
about
75%
and
the
R##40##8##Q
mutant
PA##H
about
55%
of
the

These

Gen##omi##c
organization
of
the
ad##ren##ole##uk##ody##stro##phy
gene.
Ad##ren##ole##uk##ody##stro##phy
(AL##D),
the
most
frequent
per##ox##is##oma##l
disorder,
is
a
severe
ne##uro##de##gene##rative
disease
associated
with
an
imp##air##ment
of
very
long
chain
fatty
acids
beta-oxidation.
We
have
recently
identified
by
position##al
c##lon##ing
the
gene
responsible
for
AL##D,
located
in
X##q##28.
It
en##codes
a
new
member
of
the
"
ABC
"
super##family
of
membrane-associated
transport##ers
that
shows,
in
particular,
significant
ho##mology
to
the
70-k##D##a
per##ox##is##oma##l
membrane
protein
(PM##P##70).
We
report
here
a
detailed
characterization
of
the
AL##D
gene
structure.
It
extends
over
21
k##b
and
consists
of
10
ex##ons.
To
facilitate
the
detection
of
mutations
in
AL##D
patients,
we
have
determined
the
intro##nic
sequences
flank##ing
the
ex##ons
as
well
as
the
sequence
of
the
3
un##tra##ns##lated
region
and
of
the
immediate
5
promoter
region.
Se##quence##s
present
in
di##stal
ex##ons
cross-hybrid##ize
strongly
to
additional
sequences
in
the
human
genome.
The
AL##D
gene
has
been
positioned
on
a
pulsed-field
map
between
D##X##S##15
and
the
L##1##CA##M
gene,
about
650
k##b
upstream
from
the
color

genes.

observed
in
patients
with

(the

thus
does
not
represent

but
a

of
AL##D..
BR##CA##1
interact##s
with
components
of
the
his##tone
de##ace##ty##lase
complex.
G##er##m-line
mutations
in
the
BR##CA##1
tumor-suppress##or
gene
are
associated
with
an
increased
su##s##ce##pt##ibility
to
breast
and
o##var##ian
cancer.
BR##CA##1
contains
a
car##box##yl-terminal
domain
(BR##CT)
that
is
shared
with
several
other
proteins
involved
in
maintaining
genome
integrity.
In
an
effort
to
understand
the
function
of
BR##CA##1,
we
sought
to
is##olate
proteins
that
interact
with
the
BR##CT
domain.
P##uri##fied
BR##CT
p##oly##pe##pt##ide
was
used
as
a
probe
to
screen
a
human
place##nta
c##D##NA
expression
library
by
Far
Western
analysis.
Here
we
report
that
BR##CA##1
interact##s
in
v##ivo
and
in
v##it##ro
with
the
R##b-binding
proteins,
R##b##A##p##46
and
R##b##A##p##48,
as
well
as
with
R##b.
Moreover,
the
BR##CT
domain
associates
with
the
his##tone
de##ace##ty##lase##s
HD##AC##1
and
HD##AC##2.
These
results
demonstrate
that
BR##CA##1
interact##s
with
components
of
the
his##tone
de##ace##ty##lase
complex,
and
therefore
may
explain
the
involvement
of
BR##CA##1
in
multiple
processes
such
as
transcription,
DNA
repair,
and
re##comb##ination..
Del##eti##on
of
the
K##IT
and
PD##G##F##RA
genes
in
a
patient
with
pie##bal##dis##m.
We
have
previously
shown
that
human
pie##bal##dis##m
results
from
mutations
of
the
K##IT
gene,
which
en##codes
the
receptor
for
the
mast/stem
cell
growth
factor
and
is
located
in
chromosome
segment
4##q##12.
Using
DNA
of
a
patient
with
pie##bal##dis##m,
mental
re##tar##dation,
and
multiple
con##gen##ital
an##oma##lies
associated
with
a

we
carried
out
quantitative
Southern

analyses
of
the
K##IT
gene
and
the
adjacent
PD##G##F##RA
(plate##let-derived

alpha
subunit)
genes.
The
patient
was
hem##iz##y##go##us
for
both
the
K##IT
and
PD##G##F##RA
genes,
indicating
that
both
of
these
genes
are
included
within
the
deleted
region.
Therefore,
del##eti##on
of
the
K##IT
and
PD##G##F##RA
genes
may
account
for
the
pie##bal##d

in
this

The

A
common
molecular
basis
for
rear##rang##ement
disorders
on
chromosome
22##q##11.
The
chromosome
22##q##11
region
is
susceptible
to
rear##rang##ement##s
that
are
associated
with
con##gen##ital
an##oma##ly
disorders
and
ma##li##gnant
tumors.
Three
con##gen##ital
an##oma##ly
disorders,
cat-eye
syndrome,
der
()
syndrome
and
ve##lo-card##io-facial
syndrome/Di##G##eor##ge
syndrome
(VC##FS/D##GS)
are
associated
with
te##tras##omy,
t##ris##omy
or
mon##oso##my,
respectively,
for
part
of
chromosome
22##q##11.
VC##FS/D##GS
is
the
most
common
syndrome
associated
with
22##q##11
rear##rang##ement##s.
In
order
to
determine
whether
there
are
particular
regions
on
22##q##11
that
are
prone
to
rear##rang##ement##s,
the
del##eti##on
end-points
in
a
large
number
of
VC##FS/D##GS
patients
were
defined
by
ha##p##lot##ype
analysis.
Most
VC##FS/D##GS
patients
have
a
similar
3
M##b
del##eti##on,
some
have
a
nest##ed
di##stal
del##eti##on
break##point
resulting
in
a
1.
5
M##b
del##eti##on
and
a
few
rare
patients
have
unique
del##eti##ons
or
trans##location##s.
The
high
prevalence
of
the
disorder
in
the
population
and
the
fact
that
most
cases
occur
s##poradic##ally
suggest
that
sequences
at
or
near
the
break##points
con##fer
su##s##ce##pt##ibility
to
chromosome
rear##rang##ement##s.
To
investigate
this
hypothesis,
we
developed
ha##ms##ter-human
so##matic
hybrid
cell
lines
from
VC##FS/D##GS
patients
with
all
three
classes
of
del##eti##ons
and
we
now
show
that
the
break##points
occur
within
similar
low
copy
repeats,
termed
L##CR##22##s.
To
support
this
idea
further,
we
identified
a
family
that
carries
an
inter##st##iti##al
du##plication
of
the
same
3
M##b
region
that
is
deleted
in
VC##FS/D##GS
patients.
We
present
models
to
explain
how
the
L##CR##22##s
can
media##te
different
ho##mo##log##ous
re##comb##ination
events,
thereby
generating
a
number
of
rear##rang##ement##s
that
are
associated
with
con##gen##ital
an##oma##ly
disorders.
We
identified
five
additional
copies
of
the
L##CR##22
on
22##q##11
that
may
media##te
other
rear##rang##ement##s
leading
to
disease.

As
part
of
a
strategy
to
clone
the
HD
gene
on
the
basis
of
its

we
isolated
g##eno##mic
DNA
from
the
HD
region
as
a
set
of
overlapping
yeast
artificial

(Y##AC)
clone##s.
Twenty-eight
Y##AC
clone##s
were
identified
by
screening
human
Y##AC
libraries
with
twelve
PC##R-based
sequence-tag##ged
sites
(STS##s)
from
the
region.
We
assembled
the
Y##AC
clone##s
into
overlapping
sets
by
hybrid##izing
them
to
a
large
number
of
DNA
probe##s
from
the
HD
region,
including
the
STS##s.
In
addition,
we
isolated
the
ends
of
the
human
DNA
insert##s
of
most
of
the
Y##AC
clone##s
to
assist
in
the
construction
of
the

Although
almost
half
of
the
Y##AC##s
appear
to
contain
ch##ime##ric

and
several
contain
internal

we
were
able
to
obtain

Ten
of
the

Three
novel
mutations
in
five
unrelated
subjects
with
hereditary
protein
S
deficiency
type
I.
A
panel
of
eight
unrelated
subjects
with
inherited
type
I
protein
S
deficiency
was
screened
for
mutations
in
the
PR##OS##1
gene.
In
five
subjects
an
abnormal##ity
was
found
but
mutations
were
not
detected
in
the
remaining
three
subjects.
Two
subjects
shared
a
G--

A
transition
at
position
+
5
of
the
donor
s##p##lice
site
consensus
sequence
of
intro##n
10.
Also
in
two
subjects
an
A--
>
T
trans##version
was
detected
in
the
stop##co##don
of
the
PR##OS##1
gene;
this
trans##version
predict##s
a
protein
S
molecule
that
is
extended
by
14
amino
acids.
The
fifth
subject
was
found
to
possess
two
sequence
abnormal##ities.
One
all##ele
carried
a
G--
>
A
transition
near
the
donor
s##p##lice
junction
of
intro##n
2,
but
this
abnormal##ity
is
probably
neutral,
since
it
was
inherited
from
the
parent
with
normal
protein
S
anti##gen
levels.
In
the
other
all##ele
a
single
T
insertion
in
co##don
-25
was
found.
Analysis
of
plate##let
RNA
showed
that
only
the
m##RNA
with
the
A--

T
mutation
in
the
stop##co##don
is
present
in
amounts
comparable
to
wild##type
RNA.
m##RNA
from
the
all##ele##s
with
the
other
two
mutations
was
either
und##ete##ct##able
or
present
in
greatly
reduced
amounts.
The
latter
indicates
that
a
m##RNA
based
approach
is
not
feasible

A
potential
animal
model
for
Les##ch-N##y##han
syndrome
through
introduction
of
HP##RT
mutations
into
mice.
The
human
Les##ch-N##y##han
syndrome
is
a
rare
ne##uro##logical
and
behaviour##al
disorder,
affecting
only
males,
which
is
caused
by
an
inherited

in
the

of
activity
of
the
pu##rine
salvage
enzyme
h##y##pox##ant##hine-g##uan##os##ine
p##hos##ph##ori##bos##yl

(HP##RT).
How
the
resulting
alterations
in
pu##rine
metabolism
lead
to
the
severe
symptoms
characteristic
of
Les##ch-N##y##han
patients
is
still
not
understood.
No
mutations
at
the
H##p##rt

leading
to
loss
of
activity
have
been
described
in
laboratory
animals.
To
derive
an

we
have
used

m##uta##gen##ized
by
re##tro##vir##al

and
selected
for

Male

representing

D##MD
c##D##NA.
With
careful
quantitative
analysis
of
hybrid##ization
band
intensity,
10
cases
were
found
to
carry
a
du##plication
of
part
of
the
gene,
a
frequency
of
14%
for
non##del##eti##on
cases
(10/72),
or
6%
for
all
cases
(10/181).
The
extent
of
these
du##plication##s
has
been
characterized
according
to
the
published
ex##on-containing
Hi##nd##II##I
fragment
map,
and
in
six
of
the
10
du##plication##s
a
novel
restriction
fragment
that
spanned
the
du##plication
junction
was
detected.
The
resulting
translation##al
reading
frame
of
m##RNA
has
been
predicted
for
nine
du##plication##s.
A
shift
of
the
reading
frame
was
predicted
in
four
of
the
six
D##MD
cases
and
in
one
of
the
two
intermediate
cases,
while
the
reading
frame
remained
un##int##er##rup##ted
in
both
B##MD
cases.
RF##LP
and
quantitative
Southern
b##lot
analyses
revealed
a
grand##pate##rnal
origin
of
du##plication
in
four
families
and
grand##mate##rnal
origin
in
one

In
all
five
families,
the
du##plication
was
found
to
originate
from
a
single
X

Un##e##qua##l
sister-ch##roma##ti##d

is
proposed
to
be
the

for

Thus,

predict##s
that

at

must
occur
frequently
in

for

This

would
be
expected
to
result
in
a

some
of
which
may
be
novel.
As
we
report
here,
the
mutations
in
the
hp##rt
gene
of
seven
L-N
patients,
selected
from
an
initial
survey
of
28
patients,
have
been
characterized
and
all
were
found
to
be
distinctly
different,
as
predicted.
The
origin
of
one

has
been
identified
by
analysis
of

from
four
generations
of

Further
molecular
analysis
of
the
origin
of

at

The
recent
discovery
of
sequences
at
the
site
of
the
Du##chen##ne
muscular

(D##MD)
gene
in
humans
has
opened
up
the
possibility
of
a
detailed
molecular
analysis
of
the
genes
in
humans
and
in

ma##mmal##ian
species.
Until
relatively
recently,
there
was
no
obvious
mouse
model
of
this
genetic
disease
for
the
development
of
therapeutic
strategies.
The
identification
of
a
mouse
X-linked
mutant
showing
muscular
d##ys##tro##phy,
m##d##x,
has
provided
a
candidate
mouse
genetic
ho##mo##logue
to
the
D##MD
lo##cus;
the
relatively
mild
path##ological
features
of
m##d##x
suggest
it
may
have
more
in
common
with
mutations
of
the
Becker
muscular
d##ys##tro##phy
type
at
the
same
human
lo##cus,
however.
But
the
close
genetic
link##age
of
m##d##x
to
G##6##PD
and
H##p##rt
on
the
mouse
X
chromosome,
coupled
with
its
comparatively
mild
path##ology,
have
suggested
that
the
m##d##x
mutation
may
instead
correspond
to
Emery

d##ys##tro##phy
which
itself
is
closely
linked
to
DNA
markers
at
X##q##28-q##ter
in

on
the

the

Physical

of
the

with
4-6

RF##LP

indicate
that
the

is
a

and
that
the

contains
the

that
is

Most

has
been

that

in

(F##9)
is
similar
among

compatible
with
the

Novel
mutations
of
the
ATP##7##B
gene
in
Japanese
patients
with
Wilson
disease.
Wilson
disease
(W##D)
is
an
auto##so##mal
re##cess##ive
disorder
characterized
by
copper
accumulation
in
the
liver,
brain,
kidney##s,
and
corn##eas,
and
culminating
in
copper
toxic##ation
in
these
organs.
In
this
study,
we
analyzed
mutations
of
the
responsible
gene,
ATP##7##B,
in
four
Japanese
patients
with
W##D.
By
direct
se##quencing,
we
identified
five
mutations,
of
which
two
were
novel,
and
16
p##oly##mor##phism##s,
of
which
6
were
novel.
The
mutations
287##1##del##C
and
251##3##del##A
shift
the
reading
frame
so
that
t##runcated
abnormal
protein
is
expected.
In
contrast
to
these
mutations
found
in
patients
with
he##pa##tic-type
of
early
onset,
the
mutations
A##8##7##4##V,
R##7##7##8##L,
and
38##9##2##del##G##TC
were
either
miss##ense
mutations
or
in

1-amino
acid
del##eti##on,
and
occurred
in
the
patients
with
he##pa##to-ne##uro##log##ic
type
of
late
onset.
The
mutations
287##1##del##C
and
R##7##7##8##L
have
been
previously
reported
in
a
relatively
large
number
of
Japanese
patients.
In
particular,
R##7##7##8##L
is
known
to
be
more
prevalent
in
Asian
countries
than
in
other
countries
of
the
world.
Our
data
are
compatible
with
the
hypothesis
that
the
mutations
tend
to
occur
in
a
population-specific
manner.
Therefore,
the
accumulation
of
the
types
of
mutations
in
Japanese
patients
with
W##D
will
facilitate
the
fast
and
effective
genetic
diagnosis
of
W##D
in
Japanese
patients..

Three
novel
an##iri##dia
mutations
in
the
human
PA##X##6
gene.
An##iri##dia
(i##ris
h##y##pop##lasia)
is
an
auto##so##mal
dominant
con##gen##ital
disorder
of
the
eye.
Mu##tations
in
the
human
an##iri##dia
(PA##X##6)
gene
have
now
been
identified
in
many
patients
from
various
ethnic
groups.
In
the
study
reported
here
we
describe
PA##X##6
mutations
in
one
s##poradic
and
five
f##ami##lial
cases
with
an##iri##dia.
Of
the
four
different
mutations
identified,
one
was
identical
to
a
previously
reported
mutation
(C--
>
T
transition
at
co##don
240),
and
three
were
novel
two
in
the
g##ly##cine-rich
region
and
one
in
the
pro##line/se##rine/th##re##oni##ne-rich
(PS##T)
region.
One
PA##X##6
mutation
found
in
the
PS##T
region
was
associated
with
cat##ara##cts
in
an
an##iri##dia
family.
Another
s##p##lice
mutation
in
the
PS##T
domain
occurred
in
an
an##iri##dia
patient
with
an##os##mia
(inability
to
smell).
The
six
new
an##iri##dia
cases
reported
here
have
mutations
predicted
to
generate
incomplete
PA##X##6
proteins.
These
results
support
the
theory
that
human
an##iri##dia
is
caused
by
ha##p##lo##ins##uff##iciency
of
PA##X##6..
He##pa##to##blast##oma,
pig##mented

and
jaw

in
Gardner

He##pa##to##blast##oma
is
a
rare
neo##p##las##m
of
infants
and
children
only
recently
documented
in
association
with
hereditary
ad##eno##mat##ous
p##oly##po##sis
of
the
co##lon
[Kingston
et
al.,
1983].
We
report
four
children
with
he##pa##to##blast##oma
from
four
unrelated
families
with
Gardner
syndrome
(G##S).
One
child,
now
19
years
old,
survived
after
a
re##section
of
a
he##pa##to##blast##oma
in
infancy
and
recently
was
found
to
have
G##S.
He
has
an
associated
o##don##tom##a
and
pig##mented
o##cular
fund##us
lesions,
both
of
which
have
been
shown
to
be
clinical
markers
of
G##S.
Many
individuals
in
these
four
G##S
families,
both
affected
and
at
risk,
have
o##ste##oma##to##us
jaw
lesions
and
pig##mented
o##cular
fund##us
lesions.
A
search
for
co##lon##ic
p##oly##ps
should
be
made
in
families
of
infants
and
children
with
he##pa##to##blast##oma.
If
the
child
survives,
he
or
she
should
be
monitored
for
the
later
appearance
of
co##lon##ic
p##oly##ps.
The
finding
of
jaw
lesions
and/or
pig##mented
o##cular
fund##us
lesions
in
relatives
at
risk
are
indication##s
of
the
possible
presence
of
the
G##S
gene.
Mu##tation

in
the
CH##M
gene
of
Danish
and
Swedish
ch##oro##ider##emia
patients.
The
recent
isolation
of
the
complete
open
reading
frame
of
the
ch##oro##ider##emia
(CH##M)
gene
and
the
characterization
of
the
ex##on-intro##n
boundaries
has
paved
the
way
to
mutation
detection
in
patients
with
classical
ch##oro##ider##emia.
We
have
performed
mutation
screening
in
patients
from
15
Danish
and
Swedish
families
by
using
Southern
b##lot
hybrid##ization
and
the
polymer##ase
chain
reaction
single-strand
conform##ation
p##oly##mor##phism
(PC##R-SS##CP)
technique.
C##aus##ative
mutations
in
the
CH##M
gene
were
detected
in
at
least
12
families,
indicating
that
a
substantial
part
of
the
mutations
can
be
identified
by
this
approach.
In
four
of
these
families
del##eti##ons
of
different
sizes
were
found.
Thus,
in
one
patient,
the
del##eti##on
resulted
in
the
absence
of
only
one
ex##on,
while
in
another
the
del##eti##on
comprised
the
entire
CH##M
gene.
Map##ping
of
the
del##eti##on
end##points
in
these
four
patients
and
in
another
11
male
patients
with
size##able
del##eti##ons
enabled
us
to
construct
a
very
detailed
map
of
intervals
2
and
3
of
X##q##21.
In
the
remaining
11
Danish
and
Swedish
families
at
least
8
ca##usa##tive
mutations
were
found
by
PC##R-SS##CP
analysis
and
direct
se##quencing.
Interest##ingly,
all
CH##M
gene
mutations
detected
thus
far
in
ch##oro##ider##emia
patients
give
rise
to
the

deficiency
is
the
most
common
human
en##zy##mo##pathy,
affecting
more
than
200
million
people
worldwide.
Although
greater
than
400
variants
have
been
described
based
on
clinical
and
bio##chemical
criteria,
little
is
known
about
the
molecular
basis
of
these
G##6##PD
def##ici##encies.
Recently,
the
gene
that
en##codes
human
G##6##PD
has
been
clone##d
and
sequence##d,
which
enables
us
to
examine
directly
the
he##tero##gene##ity
of
G##6##PD
at
the
DNA
level.
During
the
past
10
years,
we
examined
the
G##6##PD
activity
in
21,
27##1
newborn
Chinese
infants
(11,
400
males
and
9,
87##1
females)
and
identified
31##4
(2.
8%)
males
and
246
(2.
5%)
females
having
low
G##6##PD
activity.
The
G##6##PD
gene
from
10
randomly
selected
affected
individuals
and
their
relatives
was
polymer##ase
chain
reaction
(PC##R)
am##plified,
sub##c##lone##d,
and
sequence##d.
Our
results
indicate
that
at
least
four
types
of
mutation
are
responsible
for
the
G##6##PD
p##oly##mor##phism
in
Taiwan.
The
first
type
of
mutation
(48##7
G----A)
was
found
in
an
affected
Chinese
with
a
G
to
A
change
at
n##uc##leo##tide
48##7,
which
results
in
a
(163)
G##ly
to
Ser
substitution.
The
second
type
of
mutation
(49##3
A----G)
is
a
novel
mutation
that
has
not
been
reported
in
any
other
ethnic
group
and
was
identified
in
two
affected
Chinese.
This
mutation
causes
an
A
to
G
change
at
n##uc##leo##tide
position
49##3,
producing
an
(165)
As##n
to
As##p
substitution.
Interest##ingly,
the
48##7
G----A
and
49##3
A----G
mutations
create
Al##u
I
and
Ava
II
recognition
sites,
respectively,
which
enabled
us
to
rapidly
detect
these
two
mutations
by
PC##R/restriction
enzyme
(R##E)
dig##est##ion
method.
The
third
mutation
(137##6
G----T)
was
found
in
four
affected
Chinese.
This
mutation
causes
a
G
to
T
change
at
n##uc##leo##tide
position
137##6
that
results
in
an
(45##9)
A##rg
to
Le##u
substitution.
The
137##6
G----T
mutation
seems
to
be
the
dominant
all##ele
that
causes
G##6##PD
deficiency
in
Taiwan.
Finally,
two
affected
Chinese
were
identified
as
having
the
fourth
mutation
(138##8
G----A).
This
mutation
causes
a
G
to
A
change
at
n##uc##leo##tide
138##8
that
produces
an
(46##3)
A##rg
to
His
substitution.
Our
studies
provide
the
direct
proof
of
the
genetic
he##tero##gene##ity
of
G##6##PD
deficiency
in
the
Chinese
populations
of
Taiwan
and
the
PC##R/R##E
dig##est##ion
method
is
suitable
for
simultaneous
detection
of
the
48##7
G----A
and
49##3
A----G
mutations.

This

rather
than
depending
on

receptor
o##li##go##mer##ization,
was
found
to
stem
from
l##igan##d-

is
necessary
for

(AR##SA)
mutations
in
a

le##uk##ody##stro##phy
(M##LD)
patient.
Fr##ag##ments
of
the
a##ryl##sul##fa##tase
A
(AR##SA)
gene
from
a
patient
with
juvenile-onset
meta##ch##romatic
le##uk##ody##stro##phy
(M##LD)
were
am##plified
by
PC##R
and
l##igate##d
into
MP##13
c##lon##ing
vectors.
C##lone##s
hybrid##izing
with
c##D##NA
for
human
AR##SA
were
selected,
examined
for
appropriate
size
insert##s,
and
used
to
prepare
single-stranded
p##hage
DNA.
Examination
of
the
entire
coding
and
most
of
the
intro##nic
sequence
revealed
two
put##ative
disease-related
mutations.
One,
a
point
mutation
in
ex##on
3,
resulted
in
the
substitution
of
is##ole##uc##ine
by
se##rine.
Introduction
of
this
alter##ation
into
the
normal
AR##SA
c##D##NA
sequence
resulted
in
a
substantial
decrease
in
AR##SA
activity
on
trans##ient
expression
in
culture##d
baby
ha##ms##ter
kidney
cells.
About
5%
of
the
control
expression
was
observed,
suggesting
a
small
residual
activity
in
the
m##uta##ted
AR##SA.
The
second
mutation,
a
G-to-A
transition,
occurred
in
the
other
all##ele
and
resulted
in
an
altered
s##p##lice-recognition
sequence
between
ex##on
7
and
the
following
intro##n.
The
mutation
also
resulted
in
the
loss
of
a
restriction
site.
Apparently
normal
levels
of
m##RNA
were
generated
from
this
all##ele,
but
no
AR##SA
activity
or
im##mu##no-cross-reactive
material
could
be
detected.
A
collection
of
DNA
samples
from
known
or
suspected
M##LD
patients,
members
of
their
families,
and
normal
controls
was
screened
for
these
mutations.
Four
additional
individuals
carrying
each
of
the
mutations
were
found
among
the
nearly
100
M##LD
patients
in
the
sample.
Gene
segregation
in
the
original
patients
family
was
consistent
with
available
clinical
and
bio##chemical
data.
No
individuals
ho##mo##zy##go##us
for
either
of
these
two
mutations
were
identified.
However,
combinations
with
other
M##LD
mutations
suggest
that
the
point
mutation
in
ex##on
3
does
result
in
some
residual
enzyme
activity
and
is
associated
with
late-onset
forms
of
the
disease.
The
s##p##lice-site
mutation
following
ex##on
7
produces
late-infant##ile
M##LD
when
combined
with
other
enzyme-null
mutations,
implying
that
it
is
completely
silent
en##zy##matical##ly..
N##ull
mutation
of
the
m##uri##ne
ATP##7##B
(Wilson
disease)
gene
results
in
in##tra##cellular
copper
accumulation
and
late-onset
he##pa##tic
nod##ular
transformation.
The
At##p##7##b
protein
is
a
copper-transporting
ATP##ase
expressed
predominantly
in
the
liver
and
to
a
lesser
extent
in
most
other
tissues.
Mu##tations
in
the
ATP##7##B
gene
lead
to
Wilson
disease,
a
copper
toxicity
disorder
characterized
by
dramatic
build-up
of
in##tra##cellular
he##pa##tic
copper
with
subsequent
he##pa##tic
and
ne##uro-logical
abnormal##ities.
Using
ho##mo##log##ous
re##comb##ination
to
disrupt
the
normal
translation
of
ATP##7##B,
we
have
generated
a
strain
of
mice
that
are
ho##mo##zy##go##us
mutant##s
(null)
for
the
Wilson
disease
gene.
The
ATP##7##B
null
mice
display
a
gradual
accumulation
of
he##pa##tic
copper
that
increases
to
a
level
60-fold
greater
than
normal
by
5
months
of
age.
An
increase
in
copper
concentration
was
also
observed
in
the
kidney,
brain,
place##nta
and
la##ct##ating
ma##mma##ry
glands
of
ho##mo-z##y##go##us
mutant##s,
although
milk
from
the
mutant
glands
was
copper
def##icient.
Mo##rp##hol##ogical
abnormal##ities
resembling
c##ir##r##hos##is
developed
in
the
majority
of
the
liver##s
from
ho##mo##zy##go##us
mutant##s
older
than
7
months
of
age.
Pro##geny
of
the
ho##mo##zy##go##us
mutant
females
demonstrated
ne##uro##logical
abnormal##ities
and
growth
re##tar##dation
characteristic
of
copper
deficiency.
Copper
concentration
in
the
liver##s
of
the
newborn
ho##mo##zy##go##us
null
mutant##s
was
decreased
dramatically.
In
summary,
in##act##ivation
of
the
m##uri##ne
ATP##7##B
gene
produces
a
form
of
c##ir##r##hot##ic
liver
disease
that
resembles

of

(AL##D)
and
one
case
of
ad##ren##omy##elo##ne##uro##pathy
(AM##N)
have
developed
in

over
three

demonstrating
that
AM##N
is

were
performed
in
10
family

including
two

and
four

identified
as

of
AL##D/AM##N.
No
pit##uit##ary-ad##rena##l

was
found
in
the
carriers.
However,
basal
morning

(ACT##H)
levels
were
marked##ly
elevated
in
the
two
males
with
AL##D
and
AM##N,
despite
the
fact
that
they
had
no
clinical
signs
of

and
that
morning
plasma
co##rt##is##ol

and
their

appeared
to
be
normal.
In
addition,
the
integrated
24-hour
response
to
the
administration
were
also
sub##nor##mal
in
these

Thus,
people

In

This

Further

revealed
a

is
an

manifest##ing
within

of

and
characterized
by
a
selective
failure
to
absorb

from
the

The
con##se##quent
severe
di##ar##r##hoe##a

are
usually
fatal
unless
these

are
eliminated
from

In##test##inal

of
G##GM
patients
have
revealed
a
specific
defect
in
Na

-dependent
absorption
of
glucose
in
the
brush

Normal
glucose
absorption
is
mediated
by
the
Na

co##tra##ns##port##er
in
the
brush
border
membrane
of
the
in##test##inal
e##pit##hel##ium.
Cell##ular
influx
is
driven
by
the
trans##me##mb##rane
Na

potential
gradient;
thereafter
the
sugar
moves
to
the
blood
across
the
b##as##olate##ral
membrane
via
the

carrier.
We
have
previously
clone##d
and
sequence##d
a
Na

co##tra##ns##port##er
from
normal

and
shown
that
this

S##G##LT##1,
resides
on

and
is

to

The
molecular
details
of
AT##M
function
in
the

system
are
unclear,
although
the
ne##uro##logical
les##ion
in
at##ax##ia-te##lang##ie##ct##asi##a
becomes
apparent
early
in

suggesting
a
developmental

The

(C##NS)
of
At##m-null
mice
shows
a
pronounced
defect
in
a##pop##tosis
induced
by
g##eno##to##xi##c
stress,
suggesting
AT##M
functions
to
eliminate
neurons
with
excessive
g##eno##mic

Here,
we
report
that
the
death

Ba##x
is
required
for
a
large
proportion
of
At##m-dependent
a##pop##tosis
in
the
developing

(I##R).
Although
many
of
the

of
the

in

were
radio##res##istan##t,
mice

for
both
Ba##x
and
At##m
showed
additional
reduction
in
I##R-induced
a##pop##tosis
in
the
C##NS.
Therefore,
although
the
major
I##R-induced
a##pop##to##tic
pathway
in
the
C##NS
requires
At##m
and
Ba##x,
a
p##53-dependent
co##lla##teral

exists
that
has
both
At##m-
and
Ba##x-independent
branches.
Further,
At##m-

in
the

We
have
evaluated
the
hypothesis
of
a

between
glucose

(G##6##PD)
deficiency
and
cancer
in
a

The

of
G##6##PD
deficiency
in
the
patients
was
not
different
from
the
incidence
in
a
group
of
16,
219

The

conclusion
resulted
from
the

of
the

Therefore
at

there
is
no
evidence
that

has
a
protective

against
development
of
hem##ato##log##ic

A
physical

We

of
a

region
on
chromosome
17##q##12-21
that
contains
the

and
P##1

onto
which
we
have
placed

We
have
localized
more

20
genes
on
this

ten
of
which
had
not
been

previously,
and
have
isolated

Sul##fa##te

characterized
by

The

responsible
for
the

(PD##S)
has
been
clone##d,
but
its

is
as

and
the

Me##chan##isms
by

We
tested
su##lf##ate
transport
in
thy##ro##cy##tes
obtained
from
Pen##dre##d

patients
and
found
that
it
was
not

This
suggests
that
pen##dr##in
in

may
not
be
a

emphasizes
the

that
remained
for
many

the

An

Here,
our
goal
was
to
estimate
the

To
do
this,
a

Our

demonstrate
that
it

ad##vis##able,
for
laboratories
carrying
out
screening
either
in
English-speaking
countries
or
in

G##er##m##line
mutations
of
the
BR##CA##1
gene
in
breast
and
o##var##ian
cancer
families
provide
evidence
for
a
g##eno##type-p##hen##otype
correlation.
Mu##tations
in
the
BR##CA##1
gene,
discovered
in
1994,
are
associated
with
an
80-90%
lifetime
risk
of
breast
cancer.
We
have
anal##ys##ed
60
families
with
a
history
of
breast
and/or
o##var##ian
cancer
for
g##er##m##line
mutations
in
BR##CA##1.
Twenty-two
different
mutations
were
detected
in
32
families
(53%),
of
which
14
are
previously
un##re##port##ed.
We
observed
a
significant
correlation
between
the
location
of
the
mutation
in
the
gene
and
the
ratio
of
breast
to
o##var##ian
cancer
incidence
within
each
family.
Our
data
suggest
a
transition
in
risk
such
that
mutations
in
the
3
third
of
the
gene
are
associated
with
a
lower
proportion
of
o##var##ian
cancer.
Ha##p##lot##ype
analysis
supports
previous
data
which
suggest
some
BR##CA##1
mutation
carriers
have
common
ancestors;
however,
we
have
found
at
least
two
examples
where
re##current
mutations
appear
to
have
arise##n
independently..

Fr##ied##re##ich
at##ax##ia
(F##RD##A),
the
most
common
auto##so##mal
re##cess##ive
at##ax##ia,
is
caused
in
almost
all
cases
by
ho##mo##zy##go##us
intro##nic
expansion##s
resulting
in
the
loss
of
f##rata##xin,
a
mitochondrial
protein
conserved
through
evolution,
and
involved
in
mitochondrial
iron
home##ost##asis.
Ye##ast
knockout
models,
and
his##to##logical
and
bio##chemical
data
from
patient
heart
bio##ps##ies
or
auto##ps##ies
indicate
that
the
f##rata##xin
defect
causes
a
specific
iron-sulfur
protein
deficiency
and
mitochondrial
iron
accumulation
leading
to
the
path##ological
changes.
A##ffe##cted
human
tissues
are
rarely
available
to
further
examine
this
hypothesis.
To
study
the
mechanism
of
the
disease,
we
generated
a
mouse
model
by
del##eti##on
of
ex##on

leading
to
in##act##ivation
of
the
Fr##da
gene
product.
We
show
that
ho##mo##zy##go##us
del##eti##ons
cause
em##b##ryo##nic
lethal##ity
a
few
days
after
imp##lant##ation,
demonstrating
an
important
role
for
f##rata##xin
during
early
development.
These
results
suggest
that
the
mild##er
p##hen##otype
in
humans
is
due
to
residual
f##rata##xin
expression
associated
with
the
expansion
mutations.
Sur##p##rising##ly,
in
the
f##rata##xin
knockout
mouse,
no
iron
accumulation
was
observed
during
em##b##ryo##nic
re##sor##ption,
suggesting
that
cell
death
could
be
due
to
a
mechanism
independent
of

revealed
that

The

The

for
link##age
to
markers
flank##ing

17##q##12-q##21.
Of
the
15
families
that
contain
cases
of
o##var##ian
cancer,
94%
were
estimated
to
be
linked
to
BR##CA##1.
In

there
was
no
overall
evidence
of
link##age
in
the
group
of
10
families
with

He##tero##zy##got##es
for
the
gene
for
A-T
are
thought
to
comprise
about
1%
of
the

and,
therefore,
it
is
important
to
know
whether
this

also
pre##dis##pose##s
the

cancer##s.
He##tero##zy##go##us

the
close

of
patients
with
A-T,
although
individual

was
estimated
to
be
greater
than
5
times
the
risk
for

The

Ex##pan##sion
of

has
been
correlated
with

of
several

We
performed
extensive

cerebral

(MR##I)
and
a

in
28
cases
of

A
highly
accurate,
low
cost
test
for
BR##CA##1
mutations.
The
hereditary
breast
and
o##var##ian
cancer
syndrome
is
associated
with
a
high
frequency
of
BR##CA##1
mutations.
However,
the
widespread
use
of
BR##CA##1
testing
has
been
limited
to
date
by
three
principal
concerns
the
fear
of
loss
of
health
and
life
insurance,
the
uncertain
clinical
value
of
a
positive
test
result,
and
the
current
lack
of
an
inexpensive
and
sensitive
screening
test
for
BR##CA##1
mutations.
We
have
developed
an
inexpensive
system
for
gene
mutation##al
scanning,
based
on
a
combination
of
extensive
multiple##x
PC##R
am##p##lification
and
two
dimensional
electro##ph##ores##is.
The
efficiency
of
this
system,
as
a
screening
test
for
BR##CA##1
mutations,
was
evaluated
in
a
panel
of
60
samples
from
high
risk
women,
14
of
which
contained
a
previously
identified
mutation
in
BR##CA##1.
All
14
mutations
were
identified,
as
well
as
an
additional
five
that
had
previously
escaped
detection.
In
addition
to
the
19
mutations,
a
total
of
15
different
p##oly##morphic
variants
were
scored,
most
of
which
were
recurring.
All
were
confirmed
by
n##uc##leo##tide
se##quencing.
The
cost
of
screening
per
sample
was
calculated
to
be
approximately
US
$
70
for
the
manual
technique
used
in
this
study,
and
may
be
reduced
to
approximately
US
$
10
with
the
introduction
of
commercially
available
PC##R
robotic##s
and
fluorescent
imaging.
I##mple##mentation
of
this
method
of

in
the
research
and
clinical
setting

G##er##m##line
mutations
of
the
AP##C
gene
in
Korean
f##ami##lial
ad##eno##mat##ous
p##oly##po##sis
patients.
We
extensively
analyzed
g##eno##mic
DNA
and
messenger
RNA
(m##RNA)
from
62
unrelated
Korean
patients
with
f##ami##lial
ad##eno##mat##ous
p##oly##po##sis
(FA##P)
for
identification
of
g##er##m##line
ad##eno##mat##ous
p##oly##po##sis
co##li
(AP##C)
gene
mutations.
We
adopted
both
single-strand
conform##ation
p##oly##mor##phism
(SS##CP)
analysis
and
a
method
of
analysis
involving
the
reverse
transcription-polymer##ase
chain
reaction
(R##T-PC##R)
followed
by
a
protein
t##run##cation
test
(PT##T).
DNA
se##quencing
confirmed
all
alterations
represented
by
a##ber##rant
bands.
G##er##m##line
mutations
were
identified
in
38
patients
(61%).
Nine##teen
of
the
detected
mutations
were
presumed
to
be
novel,
thus
emphasizing
the
he##tero##gene##ity
of
the
mutation##al
spectrum
in
Korean
FA##P
patients.
In
the
initial
48
patients,
SS##CP
analysis
was
followed
by
PT##T
for
those
patients
for
whom
no
detect##able
mutations
were
found
by
SS##CP.
Using
this
combined
approach,
we
identified
g##er##m##line
AP##C
gene
mutations
in
29
of
the
48
FA##P
patients
(60%),
including
6
patients
in
whom
SS##CP
analysis
failed
to
distinguish
the
mutant
all##ele.
In
the
14
later
patients,
we
identified
t##run##cating
mutations
in
9
patients
(64%)
using
PT##T
only.
Our
results
confirm
that
the
mutation
detection
rate
with
PT##T
was
superior
to
that
with
SS##CP,
and
suggest
that
PT##T
would
be
a
more
practical
screening
method
to
detect
g##er##m##line
mutations
of
the
AP##C
gene
in
FA##P
patients.

A
syndrome
of
micro##ce##pha##ly,

was
observed
in
two
brothers

kind##red
of
Lebanese
descent.
H##y##pot##onia,
ch##orio##ret##inal
d##ys##tro##phy,
and
my##op##ia
were
also
identified.
The
severity
of
the
condition
varied
among
the
closely
related
patients.
Because
of
absence
of
a
distinctive
facial
appearance,
the
degree
of
mental
re##tar##dation,
and
short
stature,
the
initially
considered
clinical
diagnosis
of
Cohen
syndrome
was
withdrawn
and
a
novel
genetic
entity
was
assumed.
Ho##mo##zy##gos##ity
mapping
in
this
family
assigned
the
gene
to
a
26.

This
fact
encourages
the
hypothesis
that
the
described
kind##red
se##g##re##gate##s
for
a
variant
of
Cohen
syndrome
and
suggests
a
red##ef##ini##tion
of
its
p##hen##otype
S##pont##aneous
re##version
of
novel
Les##ch-N##y##han
mutation
by
HP##RT
gene
rear##rang##ement.
Molecular
analysis
of
an
unusual
patient
with
the
Les##ch-N##y##han
syndrome
has
suggested
that
the
mutation
is
due
to
a
partial
HP##RT
gene
du##plication.
We
now
report
the
c##lon##ing
and
se##quencing
of
the
mutant
HP##RT
c##D##NA
which
shows
the
precise
du##plication
of
ex##ons
2
and
3.
This
mutation
is
the
result
of
an
internal
du##plication
of
16-20
k##ilo##base##s
of
the
gene.
The
structure
of
the
mutant
gene
suggests
that
the
du##plication
was
not
generated
by
a
single
une##qua##l
crossing-over
event
between
two
normal
HP##RT
all##ele##s.
Growth
of
E##ps##tein-Barr
virus-transformed
l##ymph##ob##last##s
from
this
patient
in
selective
medium
has
permitted
isolation
of
spontaneous
HP##RT
+
re##vert##ants
of
this
mutation.
The
re##version
event
involves
a
second
major
HP##RT
gene
rear##rang##ement
where
most
or
all
of
the
du##plicate##d
portion
of
the
mutant
gene
is
deleted.
The
original
mutation
therefore
has
the
potential
for
spontaneous
so##matic
re##version.
This
may
explain
the
relatively
mild
symptoms
of
the
Les##ch-N##y##han
syndrome
exhibited
by
this
patient..
N##ep##hr##op##athy
in
the
W##isk##ott-Al##dric##h
syndrome.
N##ep##hr##op##athy
was
detected
in
five
of
32
patients
with
the
W##isk##ott-Al##dric##h
syndrome
who
were
participating
in
a
study
of
transfer
factor
(T##F)
therapy.
In
two
patients,
ne##ph##rop##athy
was
present
before
T##F
and
did
not
appear
changed
by
T##F
therapy.
One
of
these
patients
subsequently
developed
progressive
re##nal
failure
requiring
dial##ys##is
beginning
5
1/2
years
after
T##F
therapy.
In
two
patients,
decreased
re##nal
function
appeared
very
soon
after
the
administration
of
T##F.
One
patient
showed
gradually
decreasing
re##nal
function
beginning
after
two
years
of
T##F
therapy.
An
additional
patient
was
identified
who
died
with
re##nal
failure
without
having
received
T##F.
The
results
suggest
that
re##nal
failure
occurs
in
the
W##isk##ott-Al##dric##h
syndrome
more
frequently
than
generally
recognized
and
that
administration
of
T##F
may
pre##ci##pit##ate
or
accelerate
the
re##nal
disease
in
patients
with
this
syndrome..
An##iri##dia-associated
c##yt##ogen##etic
rear##rang##ement##s
suggest
that
a
position
effect
may
cause
the
mutant
p##hen##otype.
Current
evidence
suggests
that
an##iri##dia
(absence
of
i##ris)
is
caused
by
loss
of
function
of
one
copy
of
the
PA##X##6
gene,
which
maps
to
11##p##13.
We
present
the
further
character##isation
of
two
an##iri##dia
p##ed##ig##ree##s
in
which
the
disease
se##g##re##gate##s
with
ch##rom##oso##mal
rear##rang##ement##s
which
involve
11##p##13
but
do
not
disrupt
the
PA##X##6
gene.
We
have
isolated
three
human
Y##AC
clone##s
which
en##com##pass
the
PA##X##6
lo##cus
and
we
have
used
these
to
show
that
in
both
cases
the
ch##rom##oso##mal
break##point
is
at
least
85
k##b
di##stal
of
the
3
end
of
PA##X##6.
In
addition,
the
open
reading
frame
of
PA##X##6
is
apparently
free
of
mutations.
We
propose
that
the
PA##X##6
gene
on
the
rear##ranged
chromosome
11
is
in
an
inappropriate
ch##roma##tin
environment
for
normal
expression
and
therefore
that
a
position
effect
is
the
underlying
mechanism
of
disease
in
these
families..

(As##p##44##2

within

(D##44##2##G).
The
In##t##14

mutation
was
only
found
in
one
family.
However,
the
D##44##2##G
and
In##t##14

mutations
were
highly
prevalent
in

and

respectively.
Furthermore,
prevalence##s
of
the
D##44##2##G
and
In##t##14
A
mutations
were
extremely
high
in
a
general
sample
of
Japanese
men
(n
=
236),
with
he##tero##zy##got##e
frequencies
of
7%
and
2%,
respectively.
These
two
mutations
accounted
for
about
10%
of
the
total
variance
of
HD##L-C
in
this
population.
The
p##hen##otype
in
a
genetic
compound
he##tero##zy##got##e
(In##t##14
T
and
In##t##14
A)
was
similar
to
that
of
In##t##14
A
ho##mo##zy##got##es
(no
detect##able
CE##TP
and
marked##ly
increased
HD##L-C),
indicating
that
the
In##t##14
T
produces
a
null
all##ele.
In
four
D##44##2##G
ho##mo##zy##got##es,
mean
HD##L-C
levels
(86
+/-
26
mg/d##l)
were
lower
than
in
In##t##14
A
ho##mo##zy##got##es
(158
+/-
35
mg/d##l),
reflecting
residual
CE##TP
activity
in
plasma.
In
47
D##44##2##G
he##tero##zy##got##es,
mean
HD##L-C
levels
were
91
+/-
23
mg/d##l,
similar
to
the
level
in
D##44##2##G

and
significantly
greater
than
mean
HD##L-C
levels
in
In##t##14
A
he##tero##zy##got##es
(69
+/-
15

Thus,
the
D##44##2##G
mutation
acts
differently
to
the
null
mutations
with
weaker
effects
on
HD##L
in
the
ho##mo##zy##go##us

was
used
to
produce
two

(H##fe)
lo##cus.
The
first
mutation
del##ete##s
a
large

generating
a
null

The
second
mutation
introduces
a
miss##ense
mutation
(C##28##2##Y)
into
the
H##fe
lo##cus,
but
otherwise
leaves
the
gene
intact.
This
mutation
is
identical
to
the
disease-causing
mutation
in
patients
with
hereditary
hem##och##roma##tosis.
Mi##ce
carrying

of
the
two
mutations
were
bred
and
analyzed.
Ho##mo##zy##gos##ity
for

The

of
the

are
more
severe
than
the

Interest##ingly,
although

We
conclude
that

the

Direct

that

obtained.
In

At##ax##ia-te##lang##ie##ct##asi##a

We
therefore
h##y##pot##hes##ized
that
A-T
is
due
to
o##xi##da##tive

resulting
from
loss
of

of
the

To
assess
this
hypothesis,
we
employed
an
animal
model
of
A-T,
the

We
show
that
organs
which
develop

are
targets
of

are
particularly

These

provide
a

The

of

in
75
families
where
the
pro##band
had

are

Of
the
278
adult,
living

approximately
85%
cooperate##d
in
the
study.
Clinical
and
radio##graphical
examinations
were
performed
and
H##LA

was
conducted.
The
results
were
in
agreement
with
our
hypothesis
that
an##ky##los##ing
s##po##ndy##lit##is
is
part
of
a
syndrome
where
different
genetic
factors
interact.
Such

more
frequently
found
in

than
in

Environmental
factors
(in##test##inal

are
known
to
trigger
the

at

in
some
persons,
and
we
have
post##ulated
that
all
or
most
of
them
have
the
pre##dis##position
to
develop
disease.
Thus,
the
syndrome
has
a
multi##fa##ctor##ial
et##iology.
The
p##hen##otypic
expressions
of
the
different
genetic
pre##dis##position##s
involved,
include

The

of
the
fifth

(C##5)
was
documented
in
the

This

examines
several
biological

of
C##5-def##icient
(C##5##D)
human
serum,
particularly
se##ra
obtained
from
two
C##5##D

is
completely
lacking
C##5,
while
her
healthy
half-sister
has
1-2%
of
normal

Both
se##ra
were
severely
impaired
in
their

to
generate

upon

This
function
was
fully
restored
in
the

serum,
and
substantially
improved
in
the
pro##band##s
serum,
by
addition
of
highly
pu##rified
human

to
normal
serum
concentrations.
Ser##a

were
apparently

was
completely

In
addition,

was
capable
of
promoting

(FM##F)
is
a

disorder
characterized
by
episodes
of

We
recently
identified
the
gene
causing
FM##F,
designated
ME##F##V,
and
found
it
to
be
expressed
in

suggesting
that
it
functions
as
an

ME##F##V
was
also

Among

(V##WS)
is
an

with
high

Its

c##M
region
of
chromosome
1##q##32,
with
no

The
aim
of
this
study
is
to
re##fine
the
local##ization
of
the
V##WS
gene
and
to
further
assess
possible
he##tero##gene##ity.
We
analyzed
four
multiple##x
V##WS
families.
All
available
members
were
clinical##ly

and
g##eno##type##d
for
19
short

repeat
markers
on
chromosome
1
in
the
V##WS
candidate

region.
We
performed
two-point
and
multi##point
limit
of

(L##OD)
score
analyses
using
a
high

All
families
showed
positive
L##OD

provided
highly

and
therefore
enabled
us
to
determine
the
specific
all##ele##s
se##g##re##gating
with
the
V##WS

in
each
of
our
four

We
observed
a

at
several
closely

lo##ci
among
our
four
Caucasian
V##WS
families
recruited
at
three
different

in
the
US.
These
results
suggest
the
possibility
of
a
unique
origin
for
a
mutation
responsible
for
many
or
most
cases
of
V##WS.
The
carrier

of
the
BR##CA##1
185##del##AG

is
approximately
1
percent
in
Ash##ken##azi
Jewish
individuals.
Since
BR##CA##1,
the
first
major
gene
responsible
for
inherited
breast
cancer,
was
clone##d,
more
than
50
unique
mutations
have
been
detected
in
the
g##er##m##line
of
individuals
with
breast
and
o##var##ian
cancer.
In
high-risk
p##ed##ig##ree##s,
female
carriers
of
BR##CA##1
mutations
have
an
80-90%
lifetime
risk
of
breast
cancer,
and
a
40-50%
risk
of
o##var##ian
cancer.
However,
the
mutation
s##tat##s
of
individuals
un##sel##ec##ted
for
breast
or
o##var##ian
cancer
has
not
been
determined,
and
it
is
not
known
whether
mutations
in
such
individuals
con##fer
the
same
risk
of
cancer
as
in
individuals
from
the
high-risk
families
studied
so
far.
Following
the
finding
of
a
185##del##AG
frames##hi##ft
mutation
in
several
Ash##ken##azi
Jewish
breast/o##var##ian

we
have
determined
the
frequency
of
this
mutation
in
85##8
Ash##ken##azi##m
seeking
genetic
testing
for
conditions
unrelated
to
cancer,
and
in
81##5

We
observed
the

may
be

risk
of
developing

Thirty-seven

were
analyzed
for
mutations
in

Twelve
different

and
shared
the

spanning
approximately
850

Trans##genic

sequences
with
expanded
CT##G

mimic
closely
the
D##M
CT##G
repeat
inter##gene##ration##al
and
so##matic
instability.
My##oto##nic
d##ys##tro##phy
(D##M)
is
caused
by
a
CT##G
repeat
expansion
in
the
3##UT##R
of
the
D##M
protein
kinase
(D##MP##K)
gene.
A
very
high
level
of
instability
is
observed
through
successive
generations
and
the
size
of
the
repeat
is
generally
correlated
with
the
severity
of
the
disease
and
with
age
at
onset.
Furthermore,
tissues
from
D##M
patients
exhibit
so##matic
mosaic##ism
that
increases
with
age.
We
generated
trans##genic
mice
carrying
large
human
g##eno##mic
sequences
with
20,
55
or
>
300
CT##G,
clone##d
from
patients
from
the
same
affected
D##M
family.
Using
large
human
flank##ing
sequences
and
a
large
am##p##lification,
we
demonstrate
that
the
inter##gene##ration##al
CT##G
repeat
instability
is
reproduced
in
mice,
with
a
strong
bias
towards
expansion##s
and
with
the
same
sex-
and
size-dependent
characteristics
as
in
humans.
Moreover,
a
high
level
of
instability,
increasing
with
age,
can
be
observed
in
tissues
and
in
sperm.
Although
we
did
not
observe
dramatic
expansion##s
(or
big
jumps
over
several
hundred
CT##G
repeats)
as
in
con##gen##ital
forms
of
D##M,
our
model
carrying

300
CT##G
is
the
first
to
show
instability
so
close
to
the
human
D##M
situation.
Our
three

Age
of
onset
(A##O)
of
Huntington
disease
(HD)
is
known
to
be
correlated
with
the
length
of
an
expanded
CA##G
repeat
in
the
HD
gene.
A##poli##pop##rote##in
E
(AP##OE)
g##eno##type,
in
turn,
is
known
to
influence
A##O
in
Alzheimer
disease,
rendering
the
AP##OE
gene
a
likely
candidate
to
affect
A##O
in
other
ne##uro##logical
diseases
too.
We
therefore
determined
AP##OE
g##eno##type
and
normal
CA##G
repeat
length
in
the
HD
gene
for
138
HD
patients
who
were
previously
anal##ys##ed
with
respect
to
CA##G
repeat
length.
Gen##ot##y##ping
for
AP##OE
was
performed
blind
to
clinical
information.
In
addition
to
highlighting
the
effect
of
the
normal
repeat
length
upon
A##O
in
maternal##ly
inherited
HD
and
in
male
patients,
we
show
that
the
AP##OE
e##ps##ilon##2##ep##si##lon##3
g##eno##type
is
associated
with
significantly
earlier
A##O
in
males
than
in
females.
Such
a
sex
difference
in
A##O
was
not
apparent
for
any
of
the
other
AP##OE
g##eno##type##s.
Our
findings
suggest
that
subtle
differences
in
the
course
of
the
ne##uro##de##gene##ration
in
HD
may
allow
interacting
genes
to
ex##ert
gender

and
diabetes
ins##ip##id##us
of

To
determine
the

the

A

Association

Mu##tations
of
AP##C
appear
to
initiate

Although
these
mutations
have
been
well
characterized,
little
is
known
about
the

of
the

Two

and
p##eptide

A

of
AP##C
containing
a

was
sufficient
for
the

In

F##IS##H
was

to

H##LA

and
the
genetics
of

One
hundred
and
twenty-eight
of
145
patients
with
an##ky##los##ing
s##po##ndy##lit##is
(AS)
were
found
to
be
H##LA
B##27
positive.
Five
patients
had
evidence
of
a
se##ro-negative
peripheral
art##hr##itis
resembling
peripheral
ps##oria##tic
art##hr##itis
and
3
of
these
were
B##27
negative.
One
further
B##27
negative
patients
had
a
sister
with
an##ky##los##ing
s##po##ndy##lit##is
and
ul##cer##ative
co##lit##is
and
a
mother
with
ul##cer##ative
co##lit##is.
There
was
evidence
of
a
somewhat
later
age
of
onset
of
symptoms
in
B##27
negative
patients.
These
findings
are
interpreted
as
suggesting
some
degree
of
clinical
and
genetic
he##tero##gene##ity
in
an##ky##los##ing
s##po##ndy##lit##is
with
genes
for
ps##oria##sis
and
inflammatory
bow##el
disease
being
important
in
some
individuals,
particularly
those
who
are
B##27
negative.
Twenty-five
first-degree
relatives
with
an##ky##los##ing
s##po##ndy##lit##is
were
all
B##27
positive.
The
only
instance
of
di##sa##sso##ciation
of
B##27
and
s##po##ndy##lit##is
in
a
family
was
where
the
pro##band
had
ul##cer##ative
co##lit##is
as
well
as
s##po##ndy##lit##is.
Of
13
B##27
positive
fathers
3
could
be
diagnosed
as
having
definite
an##ky##los##ing
s##po##ndy##lit##is
(23%).
These
findings
are
thought
to
provide
evidence
against
the
concept
that
the
gene
for
an##ky##los##ing
s##po##ndy##lit##is
is
not
B##27
but
a
closely
linked
gene
and
favour
the
occurrence
of
an
environmental

approximately
one-fifth
of

Late
infant##ile
meta##ch##romatic
le##uk##ody##stro##phy
in
Israel.
Met##ach##romatic
Le##uk##ody##stro##phy
(M##LD)
is
a
ne##uro##de##gene##rative
disease
in
which
the
l##ys##oso##mal
enzyme,
A##ryl
su##lf##ata##se
A
(AR##SA)
is
def##icient.
The
disease
is
inherited
as
an
auto##so##mal
re##cess##ive
trait
and
its
frequency
is
estimated
to
be
1/40,
000
live
births.
The
gene
of
AR##SA
has
been
clone##d
and
up
to
now
eight
mutations
causing
M##LD
have
been
reported.
Another
mutation,
PD,
leads
to
the
deficiency
of
the
enzyme
in
v##it##ro
(pseudo##de##ficiency)
without
any
known
clinical
effect.
The
PD
mutation
is
frequent
in
all
populations.
In
Israel,
late
infant##ile
M##LD
was
found
to
be
very
frequent
in
a
small
Jewish
is##olate,
the
Ha##bba##ni##te
Jews
(1/75
live
births).
The
molecular
analysis
demonstrated
that
in
the
Ha##bba##ni##te
population,
the
mutation
occurred
on
an
all##ele
with
the
PD
mutation.
The
loss
of
AR##SA
activity
is
due
to
a
point
mutation
C
>
T
leading
to
a
change
of
pro##line
to
le##uc##ine.
M##LD
is
also
frequent
among
Mo##sle##m
Arabs
in
Jerusalem.
The
mutation
is
a
transition
G
>
A
destroying
the
s##p##lice
donor
site
of
ex##on
2.
This
mutation
has
been
reported
in
patients
with
the
late
infant##ile
M##LD
from
different
ethnic
groups.
The
Christian
Arabs
in
Israel
also
have
a
high
incidence
of
the
disease
(1/10,
000
live
births);
the
mutation
in
this
population
is
still
unknown.
Knowledge
of
the
different
mutations
causing
M##LD
in
these
defined
populations
will
allow
a
carrier
screening
program
to
be
carried
out
and
prevent
the
birth
of
additional
affected
children..
Gen##omi##c
rear##rang##ement##s
of
the
AP##C
tumor-suppress##or
gene
in
f##ami##lial
ad##eno##mat##ous
p##oly##po##sis.
G##er##m##line
mutations
of
the
ad##eno##mat##ous
p##oly##po##sis
co##li
(AP##C)
tumor-suppress##or
gene
result
in
the
hereditary
color##ec##tal
cancer
syndrome
f##ami##lial
ad##eno##mat##ous
p##oly##po##sis
(FA##P).
Almost
all
AP##C
mutations
that
have
been
identified
are
single-n##uc##leo##tide
alterations,
small
insertion##s,
or
small
del##eti##ons
that
would
t##run##cate
the
protein
product
of
the
gene.
No
well-characterized
in##tra##genic
rear##rang##ement
of
AP##C
has
been
described,
and
the
prevalence
of
this
type
of
mutation
in
FA##P
patients
is
not
clear.
We
screened
49
potential
FA##P
families
and
identified
26
different
g##er##m##line
AP##C
mutations
in
30
families.
Four
of
these
mutations
were
g##eno##mic
rear##rang##ement##s
resulting
from
ho##mo##log##ous
and
non##hom##olo##go##us
re##comb##ination##s
mediated
by
Al##u
elements.
Two
of
these
four
rear##rang##ement##s
were
complex,
involving
del##eti##on
and
insertion
of
n##uc##leo##tide##s.
Of
these
four
rear##rang##ement##s,
one
resulted
in
the
del##eti##on
of
ex##ons
11
and
12
and
two
others
resulted
in
either
complete
or
partial
del##eti##on
of
ex##on
14.
The
fourth
rear##rang##ement
gross##ly
altered
the
sequence
within
intro##n
14.
Although
this
rear##rang##ement
did
not
affect
any
coding
sequence
of
AP##C
at
the
g##eno##mic
DNA
level,
it
caused
inappropriate
s##p##licing
of
ex##on
14.
These
rear##rang##ement##s
were
initially
revealed
by
analyzing
c##D##NA##s
and
could
not
have
been
identified
by
using
mutation
detection
methods
that
screened
each
ex##on
individually.
The
identification
of
a
rear##rang##ement
that
did
not
alter
any
coding
ex##ons
yet
affected
the
s##p##licing
further
under##sco##res
the
importance
of
using
c##D##NA
for
mutation
analysis.
The
identification
of
four
g##eno##mic
rear##rang##ement##s
among
30
mutations
suggests
that
g##eno##mic
rear##rang##ement##s
are
frequent
g##er##m##line
AP##C
mutations..
F##ami##lial
male
breast
cancer
is
not
linked
to
the
BR##CA##1
lo##cus
on
chromosome
17##q.
B##rea##st
cancer
in
men
is
about
a
hundred##fold
less
common
than
in
women
and
this
has
hind##ered
research
into
its
genetic
basis.
We
have
examined
22
families
with
at
least
one
case
of
male
breast
cancer
for
link##age
to
the
hereditary
breast
and
o##var##ian
cancer
lo##cus,
BR##CA##1,
on
chromosome
17##q.
We
found
strong
evidence
against
link##age
to
BR##CA##1
(lo##d
score-16.
63)
and
the
best
estimate
of
the
proportion
of
linked
families
was
0%
(95%
C##I
0-18%).
Our
results
indicate
that
there
is
a
gene
(s)
other
than
BR##CA##1
which
pre##dis##pose##s
to
early-onset
breast
cancer
in
women
and
which
con##fers
a
higher
risk
of
male
breast
cancer.
I##dent##ification
of
additional
p##ed##ig##ree##s
that
include
cases
of
male
breast
cancer
may
therefore
facilitate
the
mapping
and
isolation
of
this
gene.
Evidence
for

repeat
in
the
M##J##D##1
gene
and
for
conserved
ha##p##lot##ype##s
at
flank##ing
markers
amongst
Japanese
and
Caucasian
subjects
with
Mac##had##o-Joseph
disease.
The
size
of
the
(CA##G)n
repeat
array
in
the
3'
end
of
the
M##J##D##1
gene
and
the
ha##p##lot##ype
at
a
series
of
micro##sat##elli##te
markers
surrounding
the
M##J##D##1
gene
were
examined
in
a
large
co##hor##t
of
Japanese
and
Caucasian
subjects
affected
with
Mac##had##o-Joseph
disease
(M##J##D).
Our
data
provide
five
novel
observations.
First,
M##J##D
is
associated
with
expansion
f##o
the
array
from
the
normal
range
of
14-37
repeats
to
68-84
repeats
in
most
Japanese
and
Caucasian
subjects,
but
no
subjects
were
observed
with
expansion##s
intermediate
in
size
between
those
of
the
normal
and
M##J##D
affected
groups.
Second,
the
expanded
all##ele
associated
with
M##J##D
displays
inter-generation##al
instability,
particularly
in
male
me##ios##es,
and
this
instability
was
associated
with
the
clinical
phenomenon
of
anticipation.
Third,
the
size
of
the
expanded
all##ele
is
not
only
inverse##ly
correlated
with
the
age-of-onset
of
M##J##D
(r
=
-0.73##8,
p
<
0.00##1),
but
is
also
correlated
with
the
frequency
of
other
clinical
features
[e.g.
pseudo##ex##op##ht##hal##mos
and
pyramid##al
signs
were
more
frequent
in
subjects
with
large
repeats
(p
<
0.00##1
and
p
<
0.05
respectively)].
Fourth,
the
disease
p##hen##otype
is
significantly
more
severe
and
had
an
early
age
of
onset
(16
years)
in
a
subject
ho##mo##zy##go##us
for
the
expanded
all##ele,
which
contrasts
with
Huntington
disease
and
suggests
that
the
expanded
all##ele
in
the
M##J##D##1
gene
could
ex##ert
its
effect
either
by
a
dominant
negative
effect
(put##ative##ly
excluded
in
HD)
or
by
a
gain
of
function
effect
as
proposed
for
HD.
Finally,
Japanese
and
Caucasian
subjects
affected
with
M##J##D
share
ha##p##lot##ype##s
at
several
markers
surrounding
the
M##J##D##1
gene,
which
are
uncommon
in
the
normal
Japanese
and
Caucasian
population,
and
which
suggests
the
existence
either
of
common
founders
in
these
populations
or
of
chromosome##s
susceptible
to
path##olo##gic
expansion
of
the
CA##G
repeat
in
the
M##J##D##1
gene.
F##ami##lial

We
report

(P##WS).
Di##ag##nosis
was

the
basis
of

in
3
of

The

had
died
at
age
10
months
with
a
history
and
clinical
findings
typical
of
first
phase
of
P##WS.
Results
of
chromosome
studies
on
the
parents
and

si##bs
were
normal.
The
implications
of
this
unusual
f##ami##lial
occurrence
for
our
understanding
of
P##WS
are
discussed..
Age
at
diagnosis
as
an
indicator
of
eligibility
for
BR##CA##1
DNA
testing
in
f##ami##lial
breast
cancer.
We
searched
for
criteria
that
could
indicate
breast
cancer
families
with
a
high
prior
probability
of
being
caused
by
the
breast/o##var##ian
cancer
su##s##ce##pt##ibility
lo##cus
BR##CA##1
on
chromosome
17.
To
this
end,
we
performed
a
link##age
study
with
59
consecutive##ly
collected
Dutch
breast
cancer
families,
including
16
with
at
least
one
case
of
o##var##ian
cancer.
We
used
an
intake
cut-off
of
at
least
three
first-degree
relatives
with
breast
and/or
o##var##ian
cancer
at
any
age.
Sign##ificant
evidence
for
link##age
was
found
only
among
the
13
breast
cancer
families
with
a
mean
age
at
diagnosis
of
less
than
45
years.
An
unexpectedly
low
proportion
of
the
breast-o##var##ian
cancer
families
were
estimated
to
be
linked
to
BR##CA##1,
which
could
be
due
to
a
founder
effect
in
the
Dutch
population.
Given
the
expected
log##istic##al
problems
in
clinical
management
now
that
BR##CA##1
has
been
identified,
we
propose
an
interim
period
in
which
only
families
with
a
strong
positive
family
history
for
early
onset
breast
and/or
o##var##ian
cancer
will
be
offered
BR##CA##1
mutation
testing..

Pat##ients
with

typically
develop

A

results
in

in
which

develop

Although

correlation
between
the

and
the

the

We
investigated
the

for
A##FA##P
in
patients
carrying

(AP##C
(AS##9))
that
has
a

AP##C

was
found
to
down-regulate

the
major

of
AP##C,
as
did
the

showed
that
both

showed
that
46##6##6##ins##A,
a

in
AP##C
(AS##9)
in
these

did
not
in##act##ivate
the

Our
results
indicate
that
carriers
of
AP##C
(AS##9)
develop
fewer

than
do
typical

because
so##matic

However,
these

develop

more
frequently
than
does
the

This

Neither

have
been
reported
previously
for

describe
two
cases
of

of
the
e##pid##idy##mis,
both
of
which
were

Because

his##to##logical##ly,
and
because

the

analyzed
both

for
the

We

the
results

These

contain
either
a

All

Overall,
an

76%
of
the
145

are
linked
to

lo##cus.
None
of
the
13
families
with

it
is
estimated
that
92%

of
families
with
no
male

with
two

However,
there

Clinical

Thus,

the

Each

human
genetic

caused
by
a
deficiency
of

(PA##H).
We
isolated
several
mutant
PA##H
c##D##NA
clone##s
from
a
P##K##U
carrier
individual
and
showed
that
they
contained
an

116
base
pair
del##eti##on,
corresponding
precisely
to
ex##on
12
of
the
human
ch##rom##oso##mal
PA##H
gene.
The
del##eti##on
causes
the
synthesis
of
a
t##runcated
protein
lacking
the
C-terminal
52
amino
acids.
Gene
transfer
and
expression
studies
using
the
mutant
PA##H
c##D##NA
indicated
that
the
del##eti##on
a##bol##ishes
PA##H
activity
in
the
cell
as
a
result
of
protein
instability.
To
determine
the
molecular
basis
of
the
del##eti##on,
the
mutant
ch##rom##oso##mal

was
isolated
from
this

shown
to
contain
a

Thus,
the
consequence

is
the

Wolf##ram

characterized
by
juvenile-onset
diabetes

m##t##D##NA
del##eti##ons
have
been
described,
and
a
gene
(W##FS##1)
recently
has
been
identified,
on
chromosome
4##p##16,
encoding
a
predicted
89##0
amino
acid
trans##me##mb##rane
protein.
Direct
DNA
se##quencing
was
done
to
screen
the
entire
coding
region
of
the
W##FS##1
gene
in
30
patients
from
19
British
kind##red##s
with
Wolf##ram
syndrome.
DNA
was
also
screened
for
structural
rear##rang##ement##s
(del##eti##ons
and
du##plication##s)
and
point
mutations
in
m##t##D##NA.
No
path##ogenic
m##t##D##NA
mutations
were
found
in
our
co##hor##t.
We
identified
24
mutations
in
the
W##FS##1
gene
8
nonsense
mutations,
8
miss##ense
mutations,
3
in-frame
del##eti##ons,
1
in-frame
insertion,
and
4
frames##hi##ft
mutations.
Of
these,
23
were
novel
mutations,
and
most
occurred
in
ex##on
8.
The
majority
of
patients
were
compound
he##tero##zy##got##es
for
two
mutations,
and
there
was
no
common
founder
mutation.
The
data
were
also
analyzed
for
g##eno##type-p##hen##otype
relationships.
Although
some
interesting
cases
were
noted,
consideration
of
the
small
sample
size
and
frequency
of
each
mutation
indicated
no
clear-cut
correlation##s
between
any
of
the
observed
mutations
and
disease
severity.
There
were
no
obvious
mutation
hot
spots
or
clusters.
Hence,
molecular

Wolf##ram
syndrome
in
affected
families
and
for
Wolf##ram
syndrome-carrier
status
in
subjects
with
psychiatric
disorders
or

will
require
complete

of

Mat##ern##al
un##ip##are##ntal
di##so##my
for
chromosome
14
in
a

with
a
normal
ka##ryo##type.
We
report
on
a
boy
with
a
maternal
un##ip##are##ntal
di##so##my
for
chromosome
14
(UP##D
(14)).
At
7
years
of
age
he
was
referred
to
us
by
the
p##ae##dia##tric##ian
because
of
symptoms
of
P##rade##r-Will##i
syndrome
(P##WS).
He
showed
short
stature,
o##besity,
mild
developmental
delay,
cry##pt##or##chi##dis##m,
and
some
mild
d##ys##morphic
features.
The
history
further
indicated
in##tra##uter##ine
growth
re##tar##dation
at
the
end
of
the
pregnancy.
His
mother
was
44
years
of
age
at
the
time
of
his
birth.
After
birth
he
showed
h##y##pot##onia
with
poor
sucking,
for
which
g##ava##ge
feeding
was
needed.
Motor
development
was
delayed.
After
1
year
he
became
o##bes##e
despite
a
normal
appetite.
Re##current
middle
ear
infections,
a
high
pain
threshold,
and
a
great
skill
with
ji##gs##aw
puzzles
were
reported.
There
were
no
behaviour##al
problems
or
sleep
disturbance.
Ch##rom##oso##mal
analysis
was
normal
(46,
X##Y).
DNA
analysis
for
P##rade##r-Will##i
syndrome
showed
no
abnormal##ities.
Two
years
later
he
was
re-examined
because
we
thought
his
features
fitted
the
P##WS-like
p##hen##otype
associated
with
maternal
UP##D
(14).
At
that
time
pre##co##cious
pub##erty
was
evident.
DNA
analysis
showed
maternal
he##tero##dis##omy
for
chromosome
14.
In
all
the
previously
described
11
cases
with
maternal
UP##D
(14),
a
Robertson##ian
trans##location
involving
chromosome
14
was
detected
c##yt##ogen##etic##ally
before
DNA
analysis.
This
is
the
first
report
of
diagnosis
of
maternal
UP##D
(14)
based
on
clinical
features.
This
finding
under##lines
the
importance
of
DNA
analysis
for
maternal
UP##D
(14)
in
patients
with
a
similar
P##WS-like
p##hen##otype
even
without

Det##ec##tion
of
eight
BR##CA##1
mutations
in
10
breast/o##var##ian
cancer
families,
including
1
family
with
male
breast
cancer.
Gene##tic
e##pid##em##iol##ogical
evidence
suggests
that
mutations
in
BR##CA##1
may
be
responsible
for
approximately
one
half
of
early
onset
f##ami##lial
breast
cancer
and
the
majority
of
f##ami##lial
breast/o##var##ian
cancer.
The
recent
c##lon##ing
of
BR##CA##1
allows
for
the
direct
detection
of
mutations,
but
the
f##eas##ibility
of
pre##sy##mpt##oma##tic
screening
for
cancer
su##s##ce##pt##ibility
is
unknown.
We
analyzed
g##eno##mic
DNA
from
one
affected
individual
from
each
of
24
families
with
at
least
three
cases
of
o##var##ian
or
breast
cancer,
using
SS##CP
ass##ays.
V##arian##t
SS##CP
bands
were
sub##c##lone##d
and
sequence##d.
All##ele-specific
o##li##gon##uc##leo##tide
hybrid##ization
was
used
to
verify
sequence
changes
and
to
screen
DNA
from
control
individuals.
Six
frames##hi##ft
and
two
miss##ense
mutations
were
detected
in
10
different
families.
A
frames##hi##ft
mutation
was
detected
in
a
male
pro##band
affected
with
both
breast
and
pro##state
cancer.
A
40-b##p
del##eti##on
was
detected
in
a
patient
who
developed
in##tra-abdominal
car##cin##oma##tosis
1
year
after
prop##hyl##actic
o##op##hore##ct##omy.
Mu##tations
were
detected
throughout
the
gene,
and
only
one
was
detected
in
more
than
a
single
family.
These
results
provide
further
evidence
that
inherited
breast
and
o##var##ian
cancer
can
occur
as
a
consequence
of
a
wide
array
of
BR##CA##1
mutations.
These
results
suggests
that
development
of
a
screening
test
for
BR##CA##1
mutations
will
be
technically
challenging.
The
finding
of
a
mutation
in
a
family
with
male
breast
cancer,
not
previously
thought
to
be
related
to
BR##CA##1,
also
illustrate##s
the
potential
difficulties
of
genetic

for
individuals
known
to
carry

Color

in
ad##ren##omy##elo##ne##uro##pathy.
The
relationship
between
abnormal
color

and
ad##ren##omy##elo##ne##uro##pathy
(AM##N)
was
investigated
in
27
AM##N
patients
and
31
age-matched
controls
by
using
the
Far##ns##worth-Mu##nse##ll
100
Hu##e
test.
Twelve
(44%)
of
27
patients
showed
test
scores
significantly
above
normal.
The
axes
of
bi##pol##arity
determined
by
the
testing
differed
widely
between
the
patients
with
abnormal
scores,
compatible
with
the
notion
that
different
alterations
in
visual
pig##ment
genes
occur
in
different
AM##N
kind##red##s.
These
observations
confirm
our
earlier
impression
that
the
frequency
of
abnormal
color
vision
is
increased
in
these
kind##red##s,
and
it
supports
our
contention##s
that
(1)
AM##N
(and
its

are
very
closely
linked
to
the

this

A

has
been

C##f##5##6##a
and
C##f##23##a,
which
detect
ex##ons
in
the
central

of
the

gene.
One
or
more
ex##ons
were
deleted
in
60%
of
patients.
The
del##eti##ons
were
mapped
and
prove
to
be

in
size
and

particularly
in
D##MD.
Del##eti##ons
specific
to
D##MD
and
to

are
described.
Half
of
all
B##MD
patients
have
a
del##eti##on
of
one

smaller

The

have
used
them
to
identify
a

The
del##eti##on
removes
at

Our

for
defining

We

we
studied
the

using
three

The

and
her

showed
completely

that
the

By

an

is

in
X-linked
ad##ren##ole##uk##ody##stro##phy

the
AL##D
gene
is
still
unidentified.
The
AL##D
lo##cus
has
been
mapped
to
X##q##28,
like
the

A##b##nor##mal
color

has
been
observed
in
12
of
27
patients
with
ad##ren##omy##elo##ne##uro##pathy
(AM##N),
a
mild##er
form
of
AL##D.
Furthermore,
rear##rang##ement##s
of
the
color
vision
gene
cluster
were
found
in
four
of
eight
AL##D
kind##red##s.
This
led
us
to
propose
that
a
single
DNA
rear##rang##ement
could
under##lie
both
AL##D
and
abnormal
color
vision
in
these
patients.
Study
of
34
French
AL##D
patients
failed
to
reveal
a
higher
than
expected
frequency
of
green/red
visual
pig##ment
rear##rang##ement##s
3
to
the
red/green
color
vision
gene
complex.
The
previous
report
of
such
rear##rang##ement##s
was
based
on
small
numbers
and
lack
of
knowledge
that
the
frequency
of
"
abnormal
"
color
vision
array##s
on
molecular
analysis
was
twice
as
high
as
expected
on
the
basis
of
the
frequency
of
p##hen##otypic
color
vision
defects.
The
red/green
color
pig##ment
(R/G##CP)
region
was
studied
by
pulsed-field
gel
electro##ph##ores##is
in
14
of
these
patients,
and
we
did
not
find
any
fragment
size
difference
between
the
patients
and
normal
individuals
who
have
the
same
number
of
pig##ment
genes.
The
R/G##CP
region
was
also
analyzed
in
29
French
and
seven
North
American
AL##D
patients
by
using
six
g##eno##mic
DNA
probe##s,
isolated
from
a
co##sm##id
walk,
that
flank
the
color
vision
genes.
No
del##eti##ons
were
found
with
probe##s
that
lie
3
of
the
green
pig##ment
genes.
One
of
the
eight
previously
reported
AL##D
individuals
has
a
long
del##eti##on
5
of
the
red
pig##ment
gene,
a
del##eti##on
causing
blue
cone
mon##och##roma##cy.
This
finding
and
the
previous
findings
of
a
45%
frequency
of
p##hen##otypic
color
vision
defects
in
patients
with
AM##N
may
suggest
that
the
AL##D/AM##N
gene
lies
5
to
the
red
pig##ment
gene
and
that
the
frequent
p##hen##otypic
color
vision
an##oma##lies
owe
their
origin
to
deleted
DNA
that
includes
regulatory
genes
for
color
vision.
It
is
possible,
however,
that
p##hen##otypic
color
vision
an##oma##lies
in
AM##N
may
be
p##hen##oc##op##ies
secondary
to
re##tina##l
or
neural
involvement
by
the
disease.
The
single
case
of
blue
cone
mon##och##roma##cy
may
therefore
be
a
fort##uit##ous
coincidence
of
two
diseases..
Hai##m-Mu##nk
syndrome
and
Pa##pi##llon-Le##fe##vre

Of
the
many
palm##op##lant##ar

(PP##K)
conditions,
only
Pa##pi##llon-Le##fe##vre
syndrome
(P##LS)
and
Hai##m-Mu##nk
syndrome
(HMS)
are
associated
with
premature
period##ont##al
destruction.
Although
both
P##LS
and
HMS
share
the
cardinal
features
of
PP##K
and
severe
period##ont##itis,
a
number
of
additional
findings
are
reported
in
HMS
including
a##rac##hn##oda##ct##yl##y,
a##c##ro-o##ste##oly##sis,
at##rop##hic
changes
of
the
nails,
and
a
radio##graphic
def##orm##ity
of
the
fingers.
While
P##LS
cases
have
been
identified
throughout
the
world,
HMS
has
only
been
described
among
descendants
of
a
religious
is##olate
originally
from
Co##chin,
India.
Pa##rent##al
con##sang##uin##ity
is
a
characteristic
of
many
cases
of
both
conditions.
Although
auto##so##mal
re##cess##ive
transmission
of
P##LS
is
evident,
a
more
"
complex
"
auto##so##mal
re##cess##ive
pattern
of
inheritance
with
p##hen##otypic
influences
from
a
closely
linked
modify##ing
lo##cus
has
been
hypothesis##ed
for
HMS.
Recently,
mutations
of
the
cat##he##ps##in
C
gene
have
been
identified
as
the
underlying
genetic
defect
in
P##LS.
To
determine
if
a
cat##he##ps##in
C
mutation
is
also
responsible
for
HMS,
we
sequence##d
the
gene
in
affected
and
un##af##fected
subjects
from
the
Co##chin
is##olate
in
which
both
the
P##LS
and
HMS
p##hen##otype##s
appear.
Here
we
report
identification
of
a
mutation
of
cat##he##ps##in
C
(ex##on
6,
212##7##A--
>
G)
that
changes
a
highly
conserved
amino
acid
in
the
cat##he##ps##in
C
p##eptide.
This
mutation
se##g##re##gate##s
with
HMS
in
four
nuclear
families.
Additionally,
the
existence
of
a
shared
common
ha##p##lot##ype
for
genetic
lo##ci
flank##ing
the
cat##he##ps##in
C
gene
suggests
that
affected
subjects
descended
from
the
Co##chin
is##olate
are
ho##mo##zy##go##us
for
a
mutation
inherited
"
identical
by
descent
"
from
a
common
ancestor.
This
finding
supports
simple
auto##so##mal
re##cess##ive
inheritance
for
HMS
in
these
families.
We
also
report
a
mutation
of
the
same
ex##on
6
CT##SC
co##don
(212##6##C--

T)
in
a
Turkish
family
with
classical
P##LS.
These
findings
provide
evidence
that
P##LS
and
HMS
are
all##eli##c
variants
of
cat##he##ps##in
C
gene
mutations..

Because

are
mosaic
for

showed
that
in

In

the

However,
G##6##PD

has

applied
to
similar
G##6##PD

thought,
however,
to
represent
a
somewhat
he##tero##gene##ous

A

at

56##3
of
G##6##PD
Mediterranean
has
been
identified
by

and
the

has
been

by
De

in
G##6##PD
Mediterranean,
G##6##PD
Sa##ssa##ri,
and
G##6##PD
C##ag##lia##ri.
The
latter
subjects
had
an
additional
mutation,
at
n##uc##leo##tide
131##1,
that
did
not
produce
a
coding
change.
We
have
examined
g##eno##mic

of
five
patients--four
of
Spanish
origin
and
one
of
Jewish
origin--having
en##zy##matical##ly
documented
G##6##PD

All
had
both
the
mutation
at

56##3
and
that
at

131##1.
A
sixth

resembling
G##6##PD

kinetic##ally

with
a
slightly
rapid

A

It
appears
to
be
a

The

it

en##codes

is
also

an

gene
and
its
relationship
to
E##WS##R##1,
a

of
the

(q##24;

trans##location
that
character##izes
Ewing

tumors.
The
E##WS
gene
spans
about
40
k##b
of
DNA
and
is
encoded
by
17
ex##ons.
The
n##uc##leo##tide
sequence
of
the
ex##ons
is
identical
to
that
of
the
previously
described
c##D##NA.
The
first

ex##ons
en##code
the

domain
of
E##WS,
which
consists
of

An##iri##dia
is

of
the

chiefly
characterised
by
i##ris

which
can
cause

The
PA##X##6
gene
was
isolated
as
a

by
position##al
c##lon##ing
from
the
smallest

of
an##iri##dia-associated

Subsequently
PA##X##6

were
demonstrated
in
Small##eye,
a
mouse

which
is
an
animal
model
for
an##iri##dia,
and
six

In
this
paper
we
describe
four
additional
PA##X##6
point
mutations
in
an##iri##dia
patients,
both
s##poradic
and
f##ami##lial.
These
mutations
highlight
regions
of
the
gene
which
are
essential
for
normal
PA##X##6
function.
In
addition,
the
frequency
at
which
we
have
found
PA##X##6
mutations
suggests
that
lesions
in

will
account
for

have
been
anal##ys##ed
ex##on-by-ex##on
using

In
each

band
shifts
were
observed
on

disrupted

Thus,
complete

of
the
PA##X##6

is
predicted
in
all
cases.
Analysis
of
other
affected

showed
that,
in

all

carried
the

(F##RD##A)
is
the
most

The
disease
lo##cus
was
assigned
to
chromosome

and
the

gene,
ST##M##7/X##25,
has
been
isolated.
To

most

suggest
lo##cus

in
F##RD##A.
We
now
provide
strong
evidence
of
a
second
F##RD##A
lo##cus.
Study##ing
two
siblings
with
F##RD##A
from
two
families
we
did
not
detect
a
mutation
in
ST##M##7/X##25.
Ha##p##lot##ype
analysis
of
the
ST##M##7/X##25
region
of
chromosome
9
demonstrated
that
the
relevant
portion
of
chromosome
9
differs
in
the
patients.
Although
the
patients
studied
had
typical
F##RD##A,
one
si##b##pair
had
the
uncommon
s##ym##pt##om
of

In
order
to
investigate
whether
retained

reflex##es
are
characteristic
of
F##RD##A
caused
by
the
second
lo##cus,
F##RD##A##2,
we
studied
an

tend##on
reflex##es.
The
observation
of
typical
mutations
in
ST##M##7/X##25
(GAA

in
this

demonstrates
that
the

var##iably
associate
with

Clinical##ly

does
not

with

however,
and
the

is
not

The

We
show
that
Fox##c##1

mice
have
anterior

abnormal##ities
similar
to
those
reported
in
human

These
abnormal##ities
include
small

and

The
pen##et##rance
of
clinical##ly

abnormal##ities
varies
with
genetic

In
some
affected
eyes,
co##lla##gen

were
half

or
co##lla##gen
and
elastic

were
very
sparse.
Thus,
abnormal##ities
in
extra##cellular
matrix

or
organization
may
contribute
to
development
of
the
o##cular
p##hen##otype##s.
Despite
the
abnormal##ities
in
o##cular
drainage
structures
in
Fox##c##1
(+/-)
mice,
I##OP
was
normal
in
almost
all
mice
analyzed,
on
all
genetic

and
at
all

Similar

were
found
in

but
no

were

Fox##c##1

To

the

we
generated
a
stable

that
contained
a
tumor-derived
ch##ime##ric
gene
resulting
from
a
CO##IA##1

fusion.
Express##ion
of
the
fusion
protein
led
to
m##or##phological
transformation
and
increased
growth
rate
of
these
cells.
The
PD##G##F
receptor
kinase
inhibitor
C##GP##5##7##14##8##B
reversed
the
transformed
p##hen##otype
and
reduced
the
growth
rate
of
CO##L##IA##1/PD##G##FB-expressing
cells
but
had
no
effects
on
control
cells.
The
presence
of
dim##eric
CO##L##IA##1/PD##G##FB
precursor##s
was
demonstrated
through
PD##G##FB
im##mu##no##p##re##ci##pit##ations
of
metabolic##ally

and
also
by
PD##G##FB
im##mu##no##p##re##ci##pit##ations
followed
by
im##mu##nob##lot##ting
with
CO##L##IA##1
antibodies.
P##ulse-chase
studies
demonstrated
that
the
CO##L##IA##1/PD##G##FB
precursor
was
processed
to
an
end
product
that
was
in##dis##ting##ui##sha##ble
from
wild-type
PD##G##F-B##B.
Finally,
CO##L##IA##1/PD##G##FB-expressing
cells
generated
tumors
after
s.
c
c.
injection
into
nude
mice,
and
tumor
growth
was
reduced
by
treatment
with
C##GP##5##7##14##8##B.
We
conclude
that
the
CO##L##IA##1/PD##G##FB
fusion
associated
with
D##FS##P
contributes
to
tumor
development
through
e##ct##op##ic
production
of
PD##G##F-B##B
and
the
formation
of
an
auto##c##rine
loop.
Our
findings,
thus,
suggest
that
PD##G##F

could
be
a
target
for
p##har##ma##cological

The

we

The

This

For

in

with
inherited
breast-o##var##ian
cancer,
pen##et##rance##s
and
expressions
of
the
underlying

should
be
known.
We
have
previously
reported
two
BR##CA##1
founder
mutations
in
the
Norwegian
population.
Index
cases
for
the
present
study
were
found
two
different
ways
through
a
series
of
consecutive
o##var##ian
cancer##s
(n
=
16)
and
through
our
family
cancer
clinic
(n
=
14).
Alto##get##her,
20
of
the
patients
had
BR##CA##1
167##5##del##A,
and
10
had
113##5##ins##A.
Their
relatives
were
described
with
respect
to
absence/presence
of
breast
and/or
o##var##ian
cancer.
Of
133
living
female
relatives,
83
(62%)
were
tested
for
the
presence
of
a
mutation.
No
difference,
in
pen##et##rance
and
expression,
between
the
two
mutations
were
found,
whereas
differences
according
to
method
of
as##cer##tain##ment
were
seen.
The
overall
findings
were
that
disease
started
to
occur
at
age
30
years
and
that
by
age
50
years
48%
of
the
mutation-carrying
women
had
experienced
breast
and/or
o##var##ian
cancer.
More
o##var##ian
cancer##s
than
breast
cancer##s
were
recorded.
Both
pen##et##rance
and
expression
(breast
cancer
vs.
o##var##ian
cancer)
were
different
from
those
in
reports
of
the
Ash##ken##azi
founder
mutations.
Whether
the
reported
differences
reflect
true
differences
and/or
method##ological
problems
is
discussed.
An
observed
excess
of
mutation
carriers
could
not
be
accounted
for
by
method##ological
problems;
possible
explanations
were
a

Molecular
basis
of
sub##to##tal
complement
C##6
deficiency.
A
car##box##y-terminal##ly
t##runcated
but
functional##ly
active
C##6.
Individuals
with
sub##to##tal
complement
C##6
deficiency
possess
a
C##6
molecule
that
is
14%
shorter
than
normal
C##6
and
present
in
low
but
detect##able
concentrations
(1-2%
of
the
normal
mean).
We
now
show
that
this
d##ys##morphic
C##6
is
b##act##eric##idal##ly
active
and
lacks
an
e##pit##ope
that
was
mapped
to
the
most
car##box##y-terminal
part
of
C##6
using
C##6
c##D##NA
fragments
expressed
as
fusion
proteins
in
the
p##UE##X
expression
system.
We
thus
predicted
that
the
abnormal
C##6
molecule
might
be
car##box##y-terminal##ly
t##runcated
and
sought
a
mutation
in
an
area
approximately
14%
from
the
car##box##y-terminal
end
of
the
coding
sequence.
By
se##quencing
PC##R-am##plified
products
from
this
region,
we
found,
in
three
individuals
from
two
families,
a
mutation
that
might
p##laus##ibly
be
responsible
for
the
defect.
All
three
have
an
abnormal
5
s##p##lice
donor
site
of
intro##n
15,
which
would
probably
prevent
s##p##licing.
An
in-frame
stop
co##don
is
found
17
co##don##s
downstream
from
the
intro##n
boundary,
which
would
lead
to
a
t##runcated
p##oly##pe##pt##ide
13.
5%
smaller
than
normal
C##6.
This
result
was
unexpected,
as
earlier
studies
mapped
the
C##5##b
binding
site,
or
a
put##ative
en##zy##matic
region,
to
this
part
of
C##6.
Interest##ingly,
all
three
subjects
were
probably
he##tero##zy##go##us
for
both
sub##to##tal
C##6
and
complete
C##6
deficiency.
Mu##tations
of
the
V##HL
gene
in
s##poradic
re##nal
cell
car##cin##oma:
definition
of
a
risk
factor
for
V##HL
patients
to
develop
an
RC##C.
To
investigate
the
nature
of
so##matic
von
Hip##pel-Linda##u
(V##HL)
mutations,
we
analyzed
173
primary
s##poradic
human
re##nal
cell
car##cin##oma##s
for
mutations
of
the
V##HL
tumor
suppress##or
gene,
using
polymer##ase
chain
reaction
(PC##R)
and
single-strand
conform##ational
p##oly##mor##phism
analysis
(SS##CP)
of
DNA.
We
detected
abnormal
SS##CP
pattern
in
73
samples.
After
se##quencing,
we
identified
micro##del##eti##ons
in
58%
of
cases,
micro##ins##ert##ions
in
17%,
nonsense
mutations
in
8%,
and
miss##ense
mutations
in
17%.
Among
these
mutations,
50%
correspond
to
new
mutations.
V##HL
mutations
were
found
only
in
the
non##pa##pi##llar##y
re##nal
cell
car##cin##oma
(RC##C)
sub##type,
as
previously
reported.
To
compare
so##matic
and
g##er##m##line
mutations,
we
used
the
V##HL
database,
which
includes
50##7
mutations.
The
study
of
mutation##al
events
revealed
a
significant
difference
between
so##matic
and
g##er##m##line
mutations
with
mutations
leading
to
t##runcated
proteins
observed
in
78%
of
so##matic
mutations
vs
only
37%
in
g##er##m##line
mutations
(P
<
0.
00##1).
We
post##ulated
that
a
specific
pattern
of
V##HL
mutations
is
associated
with
s##poradic
RC##C.
This
pattern
corresponds
to
mutations
leading
mainly
to
t##runcated
proteins
with
few
specific
miss##ense
mutations.
We
then
analyzed
the
occurrence
of
RC##C
in
V##HL
families,
based
on
the
nature
of
mutations.
We
observed
RC##C
in
at
least
one
member
of
the
V##HL
families
in
77%
of
cases
with
mutations
leading
to
t##runcated
proteins
versus
55%
in
cases
with
miss##ense
mutations
(P
<
0.
05).
Thus,
mutations
resulting
in
t##runcated
proteins
may
lead
to
a
higher
risk
of
RC##C
in
V##HL
patients
Evidence
for
inter-generation##al
instability
in
the
CA##G
repeat
in
the
M##J##D##1
gene
and
for
conserved
ha##p##lot##ype##s
at
flank##ing
markers
amongst
Japanese
and
Caucasian
subjects
with
Mac##had##o-Joseph
disease.
The
size
of
the
(CA##G)n
repeat
array
in
the
3'
end
of
the
M##J##D##1
gene
and
the
ha##p##lot##ype
at
a
series
of
micro##sat##elli##te
markers
surrounding
the
M##J##D##1
gene
were
examined
in
a
large
co##hor##t
of
Japanese
and
Caucasian
subjects
affected
with
Mac##had##o-Joseph
disease
(M##J##D).
Our
data
provide
five
novel
observations.
First,
M##J##D
is
associated
with
expansion
f##o
the
array
from
the
normal
range
of
14-37
repeats
to
68-84
repeats
in
most
Japanese
and
Caucasian
subjects,
but
no
subjects
were
observed
with
expansion##s
intermediate
in
size
between
those
of
the
normal
and
M##J##D
affected
groups.
Second,
the
expanded
all##ele
associated
with
M##J##D
displays
inter-generation##al
instability,
particularly
in
male
me##ios##es,
and
this
instability
was
associated
with
the
clinical
phenomenon
of
anticipation.
Third,
the
size
of
the
expanded
all##ele
is
not
only
inverse##ly
correlated
with
the
age-of-onset
of
M##J##D
(r
=
-0.73##8,
p
<
0.00##1),
but
is
also
correlated
with
the
frequency
of
other
clinical
features
[e.g.
pseudo##ex##op##ht##hal##mos
and
pyramid##al
signs
were
more
frequent
in
subjects
with
large
repeats
(p
<
0.00##1
and
p
<
0.05
respectively)].
Fourth,
the
disease
p##hen##otype
is
significantly
more
severe
and
had
an
early
age
of
onset
(16
years)
in
a
subject
ho##mo##zy##go##us
for
the
expanded
all##ele,
which
contrasts
with
Huntington
disease
and
suggests
that
the
expanded
all##ele
in
the
M##J##D##1
gene
could
ex##ert
its
effect
either
by
a
dominant
negative
effect
(put##ative##ly
excluded
in
HD)
or
by
a
gain
of
function
effect
as
proposed
for
HD.
Finally,
Japanese
and
Caucasian
subjects
affected
with
M##J##D
share
ha##p##lot##ype##s
at
several
markers
surrounding
the
M##J##D##1
gene,
which
are
uncommon
in
the
normal
Japanese
and
Caucasian
population,
and
which
suggests
the
existence
either
of
common
founders
in
these
populations
or
of
chromosome##s
susceptible
to
path##olo##gic
expansion
of
the
CA##G
repeat
in
the
M##J##D##1
gene.

We
identified
four
RNA
s##p##licing
factors--h##n##R##NP
C,
U2##AF
(U2
auxiliary
factor),
PT##B
(p##oly##py##rim##id##ine

and

(PT##B
associated
s##p##licing
factor)
--that
bind
to
two
short
regions
3
of
the
(C##U##G)
n,
and
found
a
novel
3
D##MP##K
ex##on
resulting
in
an
m##RNA
lacking
the
repeats.
We
propose
that
the
(C##U##G)
n
is
an
essential
c##is
acting
element
for
this
s##p##licing
event.
In
contrast
to
(C##U##G)
n
containing
m##RNA##s,
the
novel
is##of##orm
is
not
retained
in

:
increased

transport##er
D##MT##1.
Here##dit##ary
hem##och##roma##tosis
(H##H)
is
a
common
auto##so##mal
re##cess##ive
disorder
characterized
by
tissue
iron
deposition
secondary
to
excessive
diet##ary
iron
absorption.
We
recently
reported
that
H##F##E,
the
protein
defect##ive
in
H##H,
was
physically
associated
with
the
transfer##rin
receptor
(T##f##R)
in
duo##den##al
cry##pt
cells
and
proposed
that
mutations
in
H##F##E
at##ten##uate
the
up##take
of
transfer##rin-bound
iron
from
plasma
by
duo##den##al
cry##pt
cells,
leading
to
up-regulation
of
transport##ers
for
diet##ary
iron.
Here,
we
tested
the
hypothesis
that
H##F##E-/-
mice
have
increased
duo##den##al
expression
of
the
di##valent
metal
transport##er
(D##MT##1).
By
4
weeks
of
age,
the
H##F##E-/-
mice
demonstrated
iron

when
compared
with
H##F##E
+/+
litter##mates,
with
elevated
transfer##rin
sat##uration##s
(68.
4%
vs.
49.
8%)
and
elevated
liver
iron

(98##5
micro##gram##s
vs.
38##1
micro##gram##s).
By
using
Northern
b##lot
analyses,
we
q##uant##itated
duo##den##al
expression
of
both
classes
of
D##MT##1
trans##cripts
one
containing
an
iron
re##sp##ons##ive
element
(I##RE),
called
D##MT##1
(I##RE),
and
one
containing
no
I##RE,
called
D##MT##1
(non-I##RE).
The
positive
control
for
D##MT##1
up-regulation
was
a
m##uri##ne
model
of
diet##ary
iron
deficiency
that
demonstrated
greatly
increased
levels
of
duo##den##al
D##MT##1
(I##RE)
m##RNA.
H##F##E-/-
mice
also
demonstrated
an
increase
in
duo##den##al
D##MT##1
(I##RE)
m##RNA
(average
7.
7-fold),
despite
their
elevated
transfer##rin
sat##uration
and
he##pa##tic
iron
content.
Duo##den##al
expression
of
D##MT##1
(non-I##RE)
was
not
increased,
nor
was
he##pa##tic
expression
of
D##MT##1
increased.
These
data
support
the
model
for
H##H
in
which
H##F##E
mutations
lead
to
inappropriate##ly
low
cry##pt
cell
iron,
with
result##ant

Ye##ast
artificial
chromosome##s
for
the
molecular
analysis
of
the
f##ami##lial
p##oly##po##sis
AP##C
gene
region.
Two
yeast
artificial
chromosome##s
(Y##AC##s)
spanning
a
total
distance
of
1.
1
me##ga##base
pairs
of
DNA
around
the
MCC
(for
m##uta##ted
in
color##ec##tal
car##cin##oma)
and
AP##C
(for
ad##eno##mat##ous
p##oly##po##sis
co##li)
genes
at
5##q##21
have
been
isolated
and
characterized.
Starting
from
the
MCC
gene,
a
strategy
was
undertaken
to
identify
constitutional
sub##mic##ros##copic
del##eti##ons
in
f##ami##lial
ad##eno##mat##ous
p##oly##po##sis
patients
that
might
considerably
narrow
down
the
position
of
the
AP##C
gene.
To
this
end,
Y##AC##s
identified
by
the
MCC
gene
were
screened
across
a
chromosome
5-specific
co##sm##id
library
to
provide
a
source
of
DNA
probe##s
for
g##eno##mic
scanning.
The
co##sm##ids
isolated
from
these
experiments
were
used
to
screen
a
panel
of
so##matic
cell
hybrid##s
containing
chromosome
5
segregated
from
patients
suspected
to
carry
put##ative
inter##st##iti##al
del##eti##ons.
This
screening
approach
led
to
the
confirmation
of
a
small
he##tero##zy##go##us
del##eti##on
in
a
p##oly##po##sis
patient
that
overlap##s
one
of
the
two
isolated
Y##AC##s.
This
Y##AC
has
been
shown
to
contain
the
entire
AP##C
gene,
in
addition
to
a
significant
portion
of
DNA
flank##ing
the
5
end
of
the
gene,
and
should
therefore
prove
a
valuable
resource
for
functional
studies
by
transfer

Treatment
of

A

was
performed
in

of
7
1/2
year-old

with
Du##chen##ne

(D##MD).
The

for
this

was
based
on
a

I##dent##ification
of
WA##SP
mutations
in
patients
with
W##isk##ott-Al##dric##h
syndrome
and
isolated
th##rom##bo##cy##top##enia
reveals
all##eli##c
he##tero##gene##ity
at
the
WA##S
lo##cus.
Mu##tation
in
the
gene
encoding
the
recently
isolated
WA##SP
protein
has
now
been
identified
as
the
genetic
defect
responsible
for
the
X-linked
W##isk##ott-Al##dric##h
syndrome
(WA##S),
a
primary
im##mu##no##de##ficiency
disease
associated
with
extensive
p##hen##otypic
var##iability.
To
el##uc##ida##te
the
range
of
WA##SP
mutations
responsible
for
WA##S,
we
used
PC##R-SS##CP
analysis
to
screen
for
WA##SP
gene
mutation
in
19
unrelated
boys
with
the
diagnosis
of
classical
or
at##ten##uated
WA##S
or
isolated
th##rom##bo##cy##top##enia.
All
19
patients
had
WA##SP
mutations,
each
of
which
localized
to
the
initial
three
or
terminal
three
ex##ons
of
the
gene,
and
the
majority
of
which
were
unique
in
each
case.
However,
a
miss##ense
mutation
which
results
in
substitution
of
the
a##rg##ini##ne
at
WA##S
co##don
86
was
identified
in
three
boys
with
severe
WA##S
as
well
as
in
one
boy
presenting
with
th##rom##bo##cy##top##enia
alone.
While
the
three
mutations
found
in
the
isolated
th##rom##bo##cy##top##enia
patients
leave
the
reading
frame
intact,
about
one-half
of
the
gene
alterations
detected
in
both
severe
and
at##ten##uated
WA##S
patients
result
in
frames##hi##fted
trans##cript
and
premature
translation
termination.
These
findings
therefore
confirm
the
association
of
WA##S
with
WA##SP
mutation
and
identify
WA##SP
mutation
as
a
cause
for
isolated
con##gen##ital
th##rom##bo##cy##top##enia
in
males.
While
the
WA##SP
gene
defects
responsible
for
isolated
th##rom##bo##cy##top##enia
and
other
mild
presentations
of
WA##S
do
not
appear
distinct
from
those
resulting
in
severe
WA##S,
these
data
indicate
that
analysis
of
WA##SP
gene
mutation
provides
a
valuable
tool
for
distinguishing
the
spectrum
of
WA##S
patients
and
the
subset
of
males
with
isolated
th##rom##bo##cy##top##enia
who
represent
mild

Huntington

expansion:
p##hen##oc##op##ies
or

in

Huntington
disease
(HD)
has
been
shown
to
be
associated
with
an
expanded
CA##G
repeat
within
a
novel
gene
on
4##p##16.

(IT##15).
A
total
of
30
of
1,
02##2
affected
persons
(2.
9%
of
our
co##hor##t)
did
not
have
an
expanded
CA##G
in
the
disease
range.
The
reasons
for
not
observing
expansion
in
affected
individuals
are
important
for
determining
the
sensitivity
of
using
repeat
length
both
for
diagnosis
of
affected
patients
and
for
predict##ive
testing
programs
and
may
have
biological
relevance
for
the
understanding
of
the
molecular
mechanism
underlying
HD.
Here
we
show
that
the
majority
(18)
of
the
individuals
with
normal
sized
all##ele##s
represent
mi##s##dia##gno##sis,
sample
mix-up,
or
c##lerical
error.
The
remaining
12
patients
represent
possible
p##hen##oc##op##ies
for
HD.
In
at

four
cases,
family
studies
of
these
p##hen##oc##op##ies

the

responsible
for
the

Mu##tations
in
the
HD
gene
that
are
other
than
CA##G
expansion
have
not
been
excluded
for
the
remaining
eight
cases;
however,
in
as
many
as
seven
of
these
persons,
retrospective
review
of
these
patients
clinical
features
identified
characteristics
not
typical
for
HD.
This
study
shows
that
on
rare
occasions
mutations
in
other,
as-yet-und##ef##ined
genes
can
present
with
a
clinical
p##hen##otype
very
similar
to
that

All##eli##c

carrier.
An

of
the
W##isk##ott-Al##dric##h

was
also
he##tero##zy##go##us
for
the
A
and
B
types
of
X-linked

de##hy##dr##ogen##ase
was
found.
With
her
it
became
possible
to
determine
whether
all##eli##c
exclusion
occurs
in
particular
cell-types
of
the
WA##S
carrier.
If
so,
the
remaining
cells
of
a
particular
cell-type
would
express
only
the
normal
X
chromosome
and
only
one
glucose-6-phosphate
de##hy##dr##ogen##ase
is##oe##nz##yme
would
be
demons##tra##ble.
This
carrier
had
only
the
B
is##oe##nz##yme
of
glucose-6-phosphate
de##hy##dr##ogen##ase
in
plate##lets
and
thy##mus-derived
T

although
both
is##oe##nz##yme##s
A
and
B
were
present
in
er##yt##hr##ocytes
and
ne##ut##rop##hil##s.
These
findings
suggest
that
selection
against
the
WA##S
gene
occurs
in
plate##lets
and
thy##mus-derived
T
l##ymph##ocytes
and
that
the
defects
associated
with
WA##S
expressed
in
these
cell-types
may
be
implicated
in
the

in

All
of

showed
no

confirming
that
the

is
the

in
these

A

was
observed
in
2
patients
with
ad##ren##ole##uk##ody##stro##phy
(AL##D).
This
pattern,
which
the

call
Type

is
characterized
by
the

This
is
different
from

Type

AL##D
does
not
appear
to
have

in

Pro##tein
S
deficiency
is
a
recognized
risk
factor
for
ve##nous
th##rom##bos##is.
Of
all
the
inherited
th##rom##bo##phi##lic
conditions,
it
remains
the
most
difficult
to
di##ag##nose
because
of
p##hen##otypic
var##iability,
which
can
lead
to
in##con##clusive
results.
We
have
overcome
this
problem
by
studying
a
co##hor##t
of
patients
from
a
single
center
where
the
diagnosis
was
confirmed
at
the
genetic
level.
Twenty-eight
index
patients
with
protein
S
deficiency
and
a
PR##OS##1
gene
defect
were
studied,
together
with
109
first-degree
relatives.
To
avoid
selection
bias,
we
confined
analysis
of
total
and
free
protein
S
levels
and
th##rom##bot##ic
risk
to
the
patients
relatives.
In
this
group
of
relatives,
a
low
free
protein
S
level
was
the
most
reliable
predict##or
of
a
PR##OS##1
gene
defect
(sensitivity
97.
7%,
specific##ity
100%).
First-degree
relatives
with
a
PR##OS##1
gene
defect
had
a
5.
0-fold
higher
risk
of
th##rom##bos##is
(95%
confidence
interval,
1.
5-16.
8)
than
those
with
a
normal
PR##OS##1
gene
and
no
other
recognized
th##rom##bo##phi##lic
defect.
Although
pregnancy/pu##er##per##ium
and
im##mo##bility/trauma
were
important
pre##ci##pit##ating
factors
for
th##rom##bos##is,
almost
half
of
the
events
were
spontaneous.
Re##lative##s
with
s##p##lice-site
or
major
structural
defects
in
the
PR##OS##1
gene
were
more
likely
to
have
had
a
th##rom##bot##ic
event
and
had
significantly
lower
total
and
free
protein
S
levels
than
those
relatives
having
miss##ense
mutations.
We
conclude
that
persons
with
PR##OS##1
gene
defects
and
protein
S
deficiency
are
at
increased
risk
of
th##rom##bos##is
and
that
free

offers
the

Huntington

A
40-year-old
man
with
childhood-onset
Tour##ette
syndrome
(T##S)
developed
Huntington
disease
(HD).
We
believe
this
to
be
the
first
reported
case
of
childhood-onset
T##S
with
adult
onset
HD.
Discovery
of
other
cases
with

may
provide

the

of
both

The
protein
def##icient
in
Lowe
syndrome
is
a
p##hos##pha##ti##dy##lino##si##to##l-4,5-bi##sp##hos##phate
5-p##hos##pha##tase.
Lowe
syndrome,
also
known
as
o##cu##loc##ere##bro##rena##l
syndrome,
is
caused
by
mutations
in
the
X
chromosome-encoded
O##CR##L
gene.
The
O##CR##L
protein
is
51%
identical
to
in##os##ito##l
p##oly##ph##os##phate
5-p##hos##pha##tase
II
(5-p##hos##pha##tase
II)
from
human
plate##lets
over
a
span
of
74##4
a##a,
suggesting
that
O##CR##L
may
be
a
similar
enzyme.
We
engineered
a
construct
of
the
O##CR##L
c##D##NA
that
en##codes
amino
acids
ho##mo##log##ous
to
the
plate##let
5-p##hos##pha##tase
for
expression
in
b##ac##ulo##virus-infected
S##f##9
insect
cells.
This
c##D##NA
en##codes
a##a
264-96##8
of
the
O##CR##L
protein.
The
re##comb##ina##nt
protein
was
found
to
cat##aly##ze
the
reactions
also
carried
out
by
plate##let
5-p##hos##pha##tase
II.
Thus
O##CR##L
converts
in##os##ito##l
1,
4,
5-t##ris##ph##os##phate
to
in##os##ito##l
1,
4-bi##sp##hos##phate,
and
it
converts
in##os##ito##l
1,
3,
4,
5-te##tra##kis##ph##os##phate
to
in##os##ito##l
1,
3,
4-t##ris##ph##os##phate.
Most
important,
the
enzyme
converts
p##hos##pha##ti##dy##lino##si##to##l
4,
5-bi##sp##hos##phate
to
p##hos##pha##ti##dy##lino##si##to##l
4-phosphate.
The
relative
ability
of
O##CR##L
to
cat##aly##ze
the
three
reactions
is
different
from
that
of
5-p##hos##pha##tase
II
and
from
that
of

To

we
detected
an

indicating
the

In
this

Gene##tic

Gene##tically
determined
C##3
deficiency
in
Brittany
span##iel
dogs
shares
a
number
of
bio##chemical
and
clinical
characteristics
with
the
human

In
humans,
the
gene
for
C##3
deficiency
is
a
null
gene
that
is
all##eli##c
to
the
structural
gene
for
C##3
and
is
not
linked
to
the
major

The
current
study
used
all##otype
analysis
of
can##ine
C##3
in
order
to
demonstrate
that
the
gene
for
C##3
deficiency
in
these
dogs
is
also
a
null
gene
all##eli##c
to
the
structural
gene
for
C##3.
In
addition,
preliminary
p##ed##ig##ree

suggests
that
the

C##3
deficiency
is
apparently
not
closely
linked
to
the

Thus,
it
appears
that
C##3

in
Brittany
span##iel
dogs
not
only
shares
bio##chemical

with
C##3

in

in
Ewing
family
of
tumors,
ma##li##gnant

of
soft
parts
and
des##mo##p##lastic
small
round
cell
tumors,
codes
for
an
RNA
binding
protein
with
novel
regulatory
domains.
The
E##WS
gene,
which
maps
to
band
q##12
of
human
chromosome
22,
is
involved
in
a
wide
variety
of
human
solid
tumors
including
Ewing
sa##rc##oma,
related
primitive
ne##uro##ec##to##der##mal
tumors,
ma##li##gnant
me##lan##oma
of
soft
parts
and
des##mo##p##lastic
small
round
cell
tumors.
In
these
tumors,
the
E##WS
is
fused
to
genes
encoding
transcription##al
act##iva##tors/re##press##ors,
like
F##li-1
or
er##g
or
AT##F
1
or
w##t##1.
To
better
understand
the
function
of
the
E##WS
protein,
we
clone##d
the
E##WS
c##D##NA.
Se##quence
analysis
of
this
c##D##NA
revealed
differential
s##p##licing
involving
two
ex##ons
encoding
72
amino
acids.
Both
alternatively
s##p##lice##d
trans##cripts,
E##WS
and
E##WS-b,
are
expressed
in
a
variety
of
cells.
Because
E##WS
proteins
contain
put##ative
conserved
RNA
binding
motifs,
we
studied
the
RNA
binding
properties
of
the
E##WS
protein.
The
E##WS-b
protein
binds
to
RNA
in
v##it##ro
and,
specifically,
to
p##oly
G
and
p##oly
U.
The
RNA
binding
activity
was
localized
to
the
car##box##y
terminal
86
amino
acids,
which
constitute
R##G##G
box.
Thus
the
amino
terminal
domain
of
E##WS
(N##T##D-E##WS),
which
is
involved
in
chromosome
trans##location
may
regulate
the
specific##ity
of
RNA
binding
activity
of
E##WS.

Mu##tation##al
analysis
of
E##WS-er##g
ch##ime##ric
protein
revealed
that
N##T##D-E##WS
functions
as
a

for
the

The
mutation
underlying
my##oto##nic

has
been
identified
as
an
expansion
of
a
p##oly##morphic
CT##G-repeat
in
a

encoding

uniquely
in

although
the

Character##ization
of
the

reveals
another

(D##MR-N##9)
in

to
the

D##MR-N##9

A
47-year-old
woman
with
par##ox##ys##mal
no##cturnal
ha##em##og##lo##bin##uria
(P##N##H)
was
found
to
have
an
inherited
deficiency
in
the
ninth
complement
component
(C##9).
In
complement-sensitivity
l##ys##is
tests,
80%
of
her
er##yt##hr##ocytes
were
marked##ly
complement-sensitive
(P##N##H-III).
Las##er
c##yt##of##lu##ori##metry
with
a
mon##oc##lon##al
anti##body
against
decay-a##cc##ele##rating

(D##AF)
revealed
that
95%
of
her
er##yt##hr##ocytes
were
D##AF-negative.
Sur##p##rising##ly,
she
has
suffered
only
mild
ha##em##oly##sis
and
has
never
experienced
massive
spontaneous
ha##em##oly##sis.
Gross
ha##em##og##lo##bin##uria
and
j##au##ndi##ce
occurred
only
after
receiving

of
whole

In
her
serum,
C##9
was
not
detect##able
either
by

by
functional
ass##ays.
Both
the
Ham

and
the
sugar
water
test
using
normal
human
serum
or

yielded
marked
ha##em##oly##sis
of
the

When
the

was
used,
only
a

of

was
detected.
Ad##dition
of
pu##rified
human
C##9
to
her

fully
restored

These
observations
indicated
that
C##9
may
play
a
critical
role
in
ha##em##oly##tic
attacks
in
patients
with
P##N##H
and
that
characteristic

Using
a

we
have
isolated
a

from
human

displaying
ch##roma##tin-re##mo##del##ing

Mass

of

of
this

indicated
that
BR##CA##1
is
associated
with
a
S##WI/S##NF-related
complex.
We
show
that
BR##CA##1
can
directly
interact
with
the
BR##G##1
subunit
of
the
S##WI/S##NF
complex.
Moreover,
p##53-mediated

gene
was
transmitted
from
the
healthy

to
his
three

including
the

These
findings
indicate
that
the

was
a

The

However,
a

Abe##rra##nt

m##RNA:
the
major
cause
for
p##hen##yl##ket##on##uria
in
parts
of
southern
Europe.
We
report
a
mutation
within
the
p##hen##yla##lani##ne
h##ydro##xy##lase
(PA##H)
gene
that
causes
a##ber##rant
s##p##licing
of

and
that
is
in
tight
association
with
ch##rom##oso##mal
ha##p##lot##ype##s
6,
10,
and
36.
Because
of
the
high
frequency
of
these
particular
ha##p##lot##ype##s
in
Bulgaria,
Italy,
and
Turkey,
it
appears
to
be
one
of
the
more
frequent
defects
in
the
PA##H
gene
causing
classical
p##hen##yl##ket##on##uria
in
this
part
of

The
mutation
is
a
G

of
the
PA##H
gene,
11
b##p

It
activate##s

This

is
probably
caused
by

To

but
the

has
remained
unclear.
We
studied
17
miss##ense

using
structural

Fifteen
miss##ense

and

(C##7##9##S,

were
characterized
by

Mu##tant

for
C##7##9##S
and
C##7##9##T,
were
des##ta##bil##ized
and
detected
as

while
the
C##7##9##S

mutant##s
were
of
a

Mu##tant##s
found
in
the

had

Mu##tant##s
found
in
the

had
a
considerable
residual

(1.
3-13.
3%
of
wild-type
GA##L##NS

Sul##fa##tase##s,
including
GA##L##NS,
are
members
of
a
highly

family
sharing
an

Thus,
a

was
constructed

and
a##ryl##sul##fa##tase

using
ho##mology
modeling,
and
32
miss##ense
mutations
were
investigated.
Consequently,
we
propose
that
there
are
at
least
three
different
reasons
for
the
severe
p##hen##otype
(i)
destruction
of
the

(ii)

(ii##i)
modification

In

were
mostly
located
on

A
family
in
which
two
male

were
affected
with
W##isk##ott-Al##dric##h

(WA##S)
was
studied
using
G-6-PD
is##oe##nz##yme##s
as
an
X-linked

in
order
to
investigate
the
nature
of
cellular
abnormal##ities.
Is##olate##d

from
the

of
the

seemingly
failed
to

all##ele
in
c##is
position
with
the
WA##S
all##ele
while
her

expressed
both
G-6-PD
all##ele##s.
Additionally,
a
his##to##gram
analysis
of

revealed
a
single
population
of
abnormal##ly
small
plate##lets
in
the
affected
prop##os##it##us,
whereas
the
he##tero##zy##go##us
mother
had
no

In
v##it##ro
culture
of
hem##op##oi##etic

showed
that
the

did
not

However,
a
small
number
of
cells
expressing
the
G-6-PD

linked
with
the

were
detected.
The
proportion
of
the

pro##gen##itors
was
significantly
higher
among
more
primitive
pro##gen##itors
(those
giving
rise
to
later

This
observation
suggests
that
selection
against

takes
place
in
the
hem##op##oi##etic

In

Con##fi##rma##tion
of
BR##CA##1
by
analysis
of
g##er##m##line
mutations
linked
to
breast

o##var##ian
cancer
in
ten

We
provide
genetic
evidence
supporting
the
identity
of
the
candidate
gene
for
BR##CA##1
through
the
characterization
of
g##er##m##line

in
63
breast

patients
and
10
o##var##ian
cancer
patients
in
ten
families
with
cancer
linked
to
chromosome
17##q##21.
Nine
different
mutations
were
detected
by
screening
BR##CA##1
DNA
and
RNA
by
single-strand
conform##ation
p##oly##mor##phism
analysis
and
direct
se##quencing.
Seven
mutations
lead
to
protein
t##run##cation##s
at
sites
throughout
the
gene.
One
miss##ense
mutation
(which
occurred
independently
in
two
families)
leads
to
loss
of
a
c##ys##tein##e
in
the
zinc

An

The

had
chain

Gene##tic

We
have
analyzed
the

derived
from
human

and
found
that
5
out
of
10
of
the

cell
lines
are
genetically
unstable
at
the

of
the

In

derived

from
one
of

(27##7##4;

change
their

in
a

We
conclude
that
g##eno##mic
instability
in
o##var##ian
tumors
is
a
dynamic
and
ongoing
process
whose
high
frequency
may
have
been
previously
under##est##imated
by
PC##R-based

of

We
have
identified
the
source
of
the
genetic
instability
in
one
o##var##ian
tumor
as
a
point
mutation
(R##5##24##P)
in
the
human
mi##sma##tch-repair
gene
MS##H##2
(Salmon##ella
Mu##t##S
ho##mo##logue),
which
has
recently
been
shown
to
be
involved
in
hereditary

Pat##ient

was
a
38-year-old
he##tero##zy##got##e,
and
her
normal
tissue
carried
both
mutant
and
wild-type
all##ele##s
of
the
human
MS##H##2
gene.
However
the
wild-type
all##ele
was
lost
at
some
point
early
during
tumor##ige##nes##is
so
that
DNA
isolated
either
from
the
patients
o##var##ian
tumor
or
from
the
27##7##4
cell
line
carries
only
the
mutant

of
the
human

The
genetic
instability
observed
in
the
tumor
and
cell
line
DNA,
together
with
the
g##er##m-line
mutation
in
a
mi##sma##tch-repair

suggest
that
the

is
involved
in
the

Ph##en##yl##ket##on##uria
(P##K##U)
is
caused
by
deficiency
of
the
he##pa##tic
enzyme
p##hen##yla##lani##ne
h##ydro##xy##lase
(PA##H).
A
full-length
human
PA##H
c##D##NA
sequence
has
been
inserted
into
p##zi##p-neo##SV
(X),
which
is
a
re##tro##vir##al
vector
containing
the
bacterial
neo

The
re##comb##ina##nt
has
been
trans##fected
into
ps##i
2
cells,
which
provide
synthesis
of
the
re##tro##vir##al
caps##id.
Re##comb##ina##nt
virus
was
detected
in
the
culture
medium
of
the
trans##fected
ps##i
2
cells,
which
is
capable
of
transmitting
the
human
PA##H
gene
into
mouse
N##I##H
3##T##3
cells
by
infection
leading
to
stable
incorporation
of
the
re##comb##ina##nt
pro##virus.
In##fected
cells
express
PA##H
m##RNA,
im##mu##nor##ea##ctive
PA##H
protein,
and
exhibit
p##ter##in-dependent
p##hen##yla##lani##ne
h##ydro##xy##lase
activity.
The
re##comb##ina##nt
virus
is
also
capable
of
in##fect##ing
a
mouse
he##pa##tom##a
cell
line
that
does
not
normally
s##ynth##esi##ze
PA##H.
PA##H
activity
is
present
in
the

system
is
re##con##stituted
in
the

infected
with
the
re##comb##ina##nt

Thus,
re##comb##ina##nt
viruses
containing

PA##H
c##D##NA
provide
a
means
for
introducing
functional
PA##H
into
ma##mmal##ian

can

and
has
been

We

for
mutations
using
single-strand

Three

and
a

confirming
the

of
extensive

will
enable

The
Pen##dre##d
syndrome
gene
en##codes
a
chloride-i##od##ide
transport
protein.
Pen##dre##d
syndrome
is
the
most
common
form
of
s##yn##dr##omi##c
deaf##ness
and
characterized
by
con##gen##ital
sensor##ine##ural
hearing
loss
and
go##it##re.
This
disorder
was
mapped
to
chromosome
7
and
the
gene
causing
Pen##dre##d
syndrome
(PD##S)
was
subsequently
identified
by
position##al
c##lon##ing.
PD##S
en##codes
a
put##ative
trans##me##mb##rane
protein
designated
pen##dr##in.
Pen##dr##in
is
closely
related
to
a
family
of
su##lf##ate
transport
proteins
that
includes
the
rat
su##lf##ate-an##ion
transport##er
(encoded
by
Sa##t-1;

identity),
the
human
di##ast##rop##hic
d##ys##p##lasia
su##lf##ate
transport##er
(encoded

D##T##D;
32%)
and
the
human
su##lf##ate
transport##er
down##re##gu##lated
in
ad##eno##ma
(encoded
by
DR##A;
45%).
On
the
basis
of
this
ho##mology
and
the
presence
of
a
slightly
modified
su##lf##ate-transport##er
signature
sequence
comprising
its
put##ative
second
trans##me##mb##rane
domain,
pen##dr##in
has
been
proposed
to
function
as
a
su##lf##ate
transport##er.
We
were
unable
to
detect
evidence
of
su##lf##ate
transport
following
the
expression
of
pen##dr##in
in
X##eno##pus
la##ev##is
o##ocytes
by
micro##in##jection
of
PD##S
c##RNA
or
in
S##f##9
cells
following
infection
with
PD##S-re##comb##ina##nt
b##ac##ulo##virus.
The
rates
of
transport
for
i##od##ide
and
chloride
were
significantly
increased
following
the
expression
of
pen##dr##in
in
both
cell
systems.
Our
results
demonstrate
that
pen##dr##in
functions
as
a
transport##er
of
chloride
and
i##od##ide,
but
not
su##lf##ate,
and
may
provide
insight
into

individual
and
family
members
demonstrated
link##age
of
H##LA-A2##5,
B##18

H##LA-D

showed
that
5

from
an

but
not

individuals
with

C##2.
The
ho##mo##zy##go##us
C##2-def##icient

were
H##LA-A

B
ho##mo##zy##go##us
but
he##tero##zy##go##us
at
the
H##LA-D
and
g##ly##ox##ala##se

lo##ci.
Therefore,
in
this
family,
the
C##2##o
gene
is
linked
with
two
distinct
ha##p##lot##ype##s
H##LA-A2##5,
B##18,
D##w##2,
G##L##O##1
and
H##LA-A2##5,
B##18,
D
unknown,
G##L##0##2.
These
results
could
be
explained
by
an
ancestral
re##comb##ina##nt
event,
which
occurred
between
the
C##2##o
lo##cus
and
H##LA-D
lo##cus
in
which
C##2##o
segregated
with
H##LA-B.
This
would
suggest
that
the
lo##cus
for
the
C##2##o
gene
maps
between
H##LA-B
and
H##LA-D
on
the

mutations
by

and
all##ele-specific
am##p##lification.
The
Les##ch-N##y##han
syndrome
is
a
severe
X
chromosome-linked
human
disease
caused
by
a
virtual
absence
of
h##y##pox##ant##hine-g##uan##ine
p##hos##ph##ori##bos##yl##tra##ns##fer##ase
(HP##RT)
activity.
A
partial
deficiency
in
the
activity
of
this
enzyme
can
result
in
go##ut##y
art##hr##itis.
To
determine
the
genetic
basis
for
reduction
or
loss
of
enzyme
activity,
we
have
am##plified
and
sequence##d
the
coding
region
of
HP##RT
c##D##NA
from
four
patients
one
with
Les##ch-N##y##han

(HP##RT##P##ert##h)
and
three
with

of
HP##RT
activity,
which
have
been
designated
HP##RT##U##rang##an,
HP##RT##S##wan
and
HP##RT##T##oo##won##g.
In
all
four
patients,
the
only
mutation
identified
was
a
single
base
substitution
in
ex##ons
2
or
3
of
the
coding
region,
which
in
each
case
predict##s
a
single
amino

in
the

protein.
Each
base
change
was
confirmed
by
all##ele-specific
am##p##lification
of
the
patients

DNA.
It
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
mutation
found
for
HP##RT##P##ert##h
is
identical
to
that
reported
for

We

However,
his

Using
a

this

was
found
to

some

and
90%
of
the

In

were
virtually
completely
unable
to
convert
h##y##pox##ant##hine

The

were
even
more

in
the

which
was
utilized
to

27%,
over

The

was
intermediate
in

the

Three

In
four

In
the

The

of
ch##ole##ster##yl
est##er
transfer
protein
(CE##TP)
deficiency
was
investigated
in
4
unrelated
CE##TP-def##icient
families.
The
high
density
lip##op##rote##in-ch##ole##ster##ol
levels
of
the
pro##band##s
exceeded
150
mg/d##l.
The
plasma
of
the
pro##band##s
was
totally
def##icient
in
CE##TP
activity
and
mass.
The
g##eno##mic
DNA
of
the
patients
was
am##plified
by
polymer##ase
chain
reaction,
using
two
o##li##gon##uc##leo##tide
prime##rs
located
in
the
intro##n
12
and
14
of
the
CE##TP
gene,
and
the
am##plified
products
were
directly
sequence##d.
Two
patients
were
ho##mo##zy##go##us
for
a
G-to-A
change
at
the
5-s##p##lice
donor
site
of
the
intro##n
14.
The
G-to-A
change
would
cause
impaired
s##p##licing
of
pre-messenger
RNA.
The
other
two
pro##band##s
were
he##tero##zy##go##us
for
the
mutation,
but
totally
lacked
CE##TP.
Their
lip##op##rote##in
patterns
were
also
similar
to
those
of
the
two
ho##mo##zy##got##es.
Thus,
other
genetic
defects
or
metabolic
factors
in##f##lue##ncing
CE##TP

are
implicated.
The
data
suggest
that
the
G-to-A
mutation
may
be
common
in
human
plasma
CE##TP
deficiency.
Furthermore,
there
could
be
compound
he##tero##zy##got##es
who
totally
lack

CE##TP
and
have
lip##op##rote##in

after

and
the

In
three
additional

plate##lets
contained
normal

of

but
R##i##C##of
was
very

even
though
a

there
was

all

probably
originate
from

Given
that
at

105

my##elin##op##ath##ies.
The
early
growth
response
2
gene
(E##GR##2)
is
a
Cy##s##2##H##is##2##zin##c
finger
transcription
factor
which
is
thought
to
play
a
role
in
the
regulation
of
peripheral
nervous
system
my##elin##ation.
This
idea
is
based
partly
on
the
p##hen##otype
of
ho##mo##zy##go##us
K##ro##x##20
(E##g##r##2)
knockout
mice,
which
display
h##y##po##my##elin##ation
of
the
P##NS
and
a
block
of
Sc##hwa##nn
cells
at
an
early
stage
of
differentiation.
Mu##tations
in
the
human
E##GR##2
gene
have
recently
been
associated
with
the
inherited
peripheral
ne##uro##path##ies
Cha##rc##ot-Marie-Too##th
type
1,
De##jer##ine-So##tta##s
syndrome
and
con##gen##ital
h##y##po##my##elin##ating
ne##uro##pathy.
Three
of
the
four
E##GR##2
mutations
are
dominant
and
occur
within
the
zinc
finger
DNA-binding
domain.
The
fourth
mutation
is
re##cess##ive
and
affects
the
inhibitor##y
domain
(R##1)
that
binds
the
N##AB
transcription##al
co-re##press##ors.
A
combination
of
DNA-binding
ass##ays
and
transcription##al
analysis
was
used
to
determine
the
functional
consequences
of
these
mutations.
The
zinc
finger
mutations
affect
DNA
binding
and
the
amount
of
residual
binding
directly
co##rrel##ates
with
disease
severity.
The
R##1
domain
mutation
prevents
interaction
of
E##GR##2
with
the
N##AB
co-re##press##ors
and
thereby
increases
transcription##al
activity.
These
data
provide
insight
into
the
possible
disease
mechanisms
underlying
E##GR##2
mutations
and
the
reason
for
varying
severity
and
differences
in
inheritance
patterns..
Molecular

von
Will##eb##rand
disease
(v##WD),
the
most
common
inherited

in
humans,
can
result
from
either
a
quantitative
or
a
q##ual##itative
defect
in
the
ad##hesive
g##ly##co##p##rote##in,
von
Will##eb##rand
factor
(v##W##F).
Molecular
studies
of
v##WD
have
been
limited
by
the
large
size
of
the
v##W##F
gene
and
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
v##W##F
m##RNA
from
patients.
By
use
of
an
adaptation
of
the
polymer##ase
chain
reaction,
v##W##F
m##RNA
was
am##plified
and
sequence##d
from
peripheral
blood
plate##lets.
A
silent
v##W##F
all##ele
was
identified,
resulting
from
a
c##is
defect
in
v##W##F
m##RNA
transcription
or
processing.
In
two

patients,
two
different
but
adjacent

were
identified,
the
locations
of
which

maintains
the

To

the

demonstrate
that

of
a

MS##H##2
gene
mutation
previously
identified
in
seven
kind##red##s
with
hereditary
non-p##oly##po##sis
cancer
syndrome
(H##NP##CC)
was
investigated.
The
mutation
(A--

T
at
n##t##9##43

disrupt##s
the
3
s##p##lice
site
of
ex##on

leading
to
the
del##eti##on
of
this
ex##on
from
MS##H##2
m##RNA
and
represents
the
only
frequent
MS##H##2
mutation
so
far
reported.
Although
this
mutation
was
initially
detected
in
four
of
33
color##ec##tal
cancer
families
anal##ys##ed
from
eastern
England,
more
extensive
analysis
has
reduced
the
frequency
to
four
of
52
(8%)
English
H##NP##CC
kind##red##s
anal##ys##ed.
In
contrast,
the
MS##H##2
mutation
was
identified
in
10
of
20
(50%)
separately
identified
color##ec##tal
families
from
Newfoundland.
To
investigate
the
origin
of
this
mutation
in
color##ec##tal
cancer
families
from
England
(n
=
4),
Newfoundland
(n
=
10),
and
the
United
States
(n
=
3),
ha##p##lot##ype
analysis
using
micro##sat##elli##te
markers
linked
to
MS##H##2
was
performed.
Within
the
English
and
US
families
there
was
little
evidence
for
a
recent
common
origin
of
the
MS##H##2
s##p##lice
site
mutation
in
most
families.
In
contrast,
a
common
ha##p##lot##ype
was
identified
at
the
two
flank##ing
markers
(CA##5
and
D##2##S##28##8)
in
eight
of
the
Newfoundland
families.
These
findings
suggested
a
founder
effect
within
Newfoundland
similar
to
that
reported
by
others
for
two
M##L##H1
mutations
in
Finnish
H##NP##CC
families.
We
calculated

For
both

the
pen##et##rance##s
at

60
years
for
all
cancer##s
and
for
color##ec##tal
cancer
were
0.

respectively.
The

For

there
was
a

and

These

Novel
mutation
at
the
initiation
co##don
in
the
Nor##rie
disease
gene
in
two
Japanese
families.
We
have
identified
a
new
mutation
of
Nor##rie
disease
(N##D)
gene
in
two
Japanese
males
from
unrelated
families;
they
showed
typical
o##cular
features
of
N##D
but
no
mental
re##tar##dation
or
hearing
imp##air##ment.
A
mutation
was
found
in
both
patients
at
the
initiation
co##don
of
ex##on
2
of
the
N##D
gene
(AT##G
to
GT##G),
with
otherwise
normal
n##uc##leo##tide
sequences.
Their
mothers
had
the
normal
and
mutant
types
of
the
gene,
which
was
expected
for
he##tero##zy##got##es
of
the
disease.
The
mutation
of
the
initiation
co##don
would
cause
the
failure
of
N##D
gene
expression
or
a
defect
in
translation
thereby
t##run##cating
the
amino
terminus
of
N##D
protein.
In
view
of
the
r##arity
and
marked
he##tero##gene##ity
of
mutations
in
the
N##D
gene,
the
present
apparently
unrelated
Japanese
families
who
have
lived
in
the
same
area
for
over
two
centuries
presumably
share
the
origin
of
the
mutation..
Ha##p##lot##ype
and
p##hen##otype
analysis
of
six
re##current
BR##CA##1
mutations
in
61
families:
results
of
an
international
study.
Several
BR##CA##1
mutations
have
now
been
found
to
occur
in
geographically
diverse
breast
and
o##var##ian
cancer
families.
To
investigate
mutation
origin
and
mutation-specific
p##hen##otype##s
due
to
BR##CA##1,
we
constructed
a
ha##p##lot##ype
of
nine
p##oly##morphic
markers
within
or
immediately
flank##ing
the
BR##CA##1
lo##cus
in
a
set
of
61
breast/o##var##ian
cancer
families
selected
for
having
one
of
six
re##current
BR##CA##1
mutations.
Tests
of
both
mutations
and
family-specific
differences
in
age
at
diagnosis
were
not
significant.
A
comparison
of
the
six
mutations
in
the
relative
proportions
of
cases
of
breast
and
o##var##ian
cancer
was
suggest##ive
of
an
effect
(P
=.
06##9),
with
57%
of
women
presumed
affected
because
of
the
129##4
del
40
BR##CA##1
mutation
having
o##var##ian
cancer,
compared
with
14%
of
affected
women
with
the
s##p##lice-site
mutation
in
intro##n
5
of
BR##CA##1.
For
the
BR##CA##1
mutations
studied
here,
the
individual
mutations
are
estimated
to
have
arise##n
9-170
generations
ago.
In
general,
a
high
degree
of
ha##p##lot##ype
conservation
across
the
region
was
observed,
with
ha##p##lot##ype
differences
most
often
due
to
mutations
in
the
short-tandem-repeat
markers,
although
some
likely
instances
of
re##comb##ination
also
were
observed.
For
several
of
the
instances,
there
was
evidence
for
multiple,
independent,
BR##CA##1
mutation##al
events.
A
new

A

glucose-6-phosphate
de##hy##dr##ogen##ase
(G##6##PD)
variant
associated
with
chronic
non##sp##her##oc##ytic
hem##oly##tic
an##emia
was
reported.
The
patient,
a
6-year-old
Japanese
male,
was
noticed
to
have
hem##oly##tic
an##emia
soon
after
birth,
and
a
diagnosis
of
G##6##PD
deficiency
was
made
at
the
age
of
2.
He
had
episodes
of
hem##oly##tic
crisis
several
times
after
upper
respiratory
infection.
G##6##PD
activity
of
the
patient
was
5.
5%
of
normal.
The
en##zy##matic
characteristics
were
examined
when
he
was
5
years
old,
and
his
G##6##PD
showed
faster-than-normal
electro##ph##ore##tic
mobility,
low
K##m
G##6##P,
high
K##m
N##AD##P,
low
Ki
N##AD##P##H,
normal
u##til##ization
of
substrate
analogue##s,
heat
instability,
and
a
normal
pH
op##ti##mum
curve.
From
these
results,
this
was
considered
to
be
a
new
variant
and
was
designated
G##6##PD
Na##gano.
In##fect##ion-induced
hem##oly##sis
and
chronic
hem##oly##tic
an##emia
seem
to
be
due
to
marked##ly
impaired
enzyme
activity
and
thermal
instability.
C##rani##of##ron##ton##asa##l

We
report
on
nine
patients
with

(CF##ND).
Seven
classical
cases
had
facial
features
suggest##ive
of

and
co##rona##l

Extra##c##rani##al
abnormal##ities
such
as
br##ittle
nails
with
prominent
longitudinal
groove##s
or
s##yn##da##ct##yl##y
of

were
observed
in
individual
patients.
In
two
families
the
father
of
classical
cases
showed
a
mild##er
pattern
of
abnormal##ities,
consistent
with
the
diagnosis.
We
present
a
2-

13-year
follow-up
on
our
patients.
H##y##pot##onia

Unlike
almost
all
other
X-linked

clinical

in
CF##ND
is
generally
much
more

A

of
the

was
found
in

The

was

The
W##isk##ott-Al##dric##h
syndrome
and
X-linked
con##gen##ital
th##rom##bo##cy##top##enia
are
caused
by
mutations
of
the
same
gene.
The
W##isk##ott-Al##dric##h
syndrome
(WA##S)
is
an
X-linked
re##cess##ive
disorder
characterized
by
th##rom##bo##cy##top##enia,
small
plate##lets,
e##cz##ema,
re##current
infections,
and
im##mu##no##de##ficiency.
Besides
the
classic
WA##S
p##hen##otype,
there
is
a
group
of
patients
with
con##gen##ital
X-linked
th##rom##bo##cy##top##enia
(X##LT)
who
have
small
plate##lets
but
only
trans##ient
e##cz##ema,
if
any,
and
minimal
immune
deficiency.
Because
the
gene
responsible
for
WA##S
has
been
sequence##d,
it
was
possible
to
co##rrel##ate
the
WA##S
p##hen##otype##s
with
WA##S
gene
mutations.
Using
a
finger##print##ing
screening
technique,
we
determined
the
approximate
location
of
the
mutation
in
13
unrelated
WA##S
patients
with
mild
to
severe
clinical
symptoms.
Direct
sequence
analysis
of
c##D##NA
and
g##eno##mic
DNA
obtained
from
patient-derived
cell
lines
showed
12
unique
mutations
distributed
throughout
the
WA##S
gene,
including
insertion##s,
del##eti##ons,
and
point
mutations
resulting
in
amino
acid
substitution##s,
termination,
ex##on
skip##ping,
or
s##p##licing
defects.
Of
4
unrelated
patients
with
the
X##LT
p##hen##otype,
3
had
miss##ense
mutations
affecting
ex##on
2
and
1
had
a
s##p##lice-site
mutation
affecting
ex##on
9.
Pat##ients
with
classic
WA##S
had
more
complex
mutations,
resulting
in
termination
co##don##s,
frames##hi##ft,
and
early
termination.
These
findings
provide
direct
evidence
that
X##LT
and
WA##S
are
caused
by
mutations
of
the
same
gene
and
suggest
that
severe
clinical
p##hen##otype##s
are
associated
with
complex
mutations..

kinetic
variant
of
p##hen##yl##ket##on##uria.
Ph##en##yl##ket##on##uria
(P##K##U)
is
an
auto##so##mal
re##cess##ive
disease
due
to
deficiency
of
a
he##pa##tic
enzyme,
p##hen##yla##lani##ne
h##ydro##xy##lase
(PA##H).
The
absence
of
PA##H
activity
results
in
typical
P##K##U
while
per##sistence
of
a
residual
enzyme
activity
gives
rise
to
variant
forms
of
the
disease.
We
report
here
a
3-base
pair
in-frame
del##eti##on
of
the
PA##H
gene
(delta
194)
in
a
mild
variant,
with
marked##ly
reduced
affinity
of
the
enzyme
for
p##hen##yla##lani##ne
(K##m
=
160
n##M),
and
we
provide
functional
evidence
for
responsibility
of
the
del##eti##on
in
the
mutant
p##hen##otype.
Since
the
del##eti##on
was
located
in
the
third
ex##on
of
the
gene,
which
presents
no
ho##mology
with
other
h##ydro##xy##lase##s,
we
suggest
that
ex##on
3
is
involved
in
the
specific##ity
of
the
enzyme
for
p##hen##yla##lani##ne.
Finally,
since
none
of
the
98
P##K##U
patients
tested
were
found
to
carry
this
particular
del##eti##on,
our
study
suggests
that
this
molecular
event
probably
occurred
recently
on
the

of

Direct

revealed

mutation
(ACT--

in
the

of

This

AR
mutation
has
been
reported
previously
in
a
meta##static
pro##state

cell
line,
L##NC##a##P,
where
this
mutation
con##fers
upon
the

an
altered

which
is
stimulate##d
by
est##rogen##s,

possible
that

co##don

may
provide
a

the

which
is
characterized
by
c##ere##bella##r
d##ys##function,
radios##ens##iti##vity,
ch##rom##oso##mal

pre##dis##position.
Both
the
A-T
p##hen##otype
and
the
similarity
of
the
AT##M
protein
to
other
DNA-damage
sensors
suggests
a
role
for
AT##M
in
bio##chemical
pathways
involved
in
the
recognition,
signalling
and
repair
of

(DS##B##s).
There
are
strong

the

of

and

in
A-T

and
that

The

(encoded
by
N##BS##1),
forms
a

with
MR##E##11

This
complex
local##izes
to
DS##B##s
within
30
minutes
after

radiation
(I##R)
and
is
observed
in

after
a
longer
period
of
time.
The
overlap
between
clinical
and
cellular
p##hen##otype##s
in
A-T
and
N##BS
suggests
that
AT##M
and
ni##bri##n
may
function
in
the
same
bio##chemical
pathway.
Here
we
demonstrate
that
ni##bri##n
is
p##hos##ph##ory##lated
within
one

of

of

with
I##R.
This

is

in

that
either
do
not
express

For

Several

In

is
an

The
severity
of
the
disease
co##rrel##ates
with
the
position
of
the
inherited
AP##C
mutation
(g##eno##type-p##hen##otype
correlation).
Together
with
the
fact
that
both
g##er##m-line
and
s##poradic
AP##C
mutations
cluster
in
the
central
region
of
the
AP##C
gene,
this
points
to
a
dominant
negative
effect
of
certain
AP##C
mutant##s.
Loss
of
AP##C
function
was
recently
shown
to
result
in
enhanced
beta-cat##eni##n-/T##c##f-mediated
transcription
in
co##lon

cells.
Here,
we
provide
experimental
evidence
for
a
dominant
negative
effect
of
AP##C
gene
products
associated
with
severe
p##oly##po##sis.
Wild-type
AP##C
activity
in
beta-cat##eni##n-/T##c##f-mediated
transcription
was
strongly
in##hibit##ed
by
a
mutant
AP##C
that
is
t##runcated
at
co##don
130##9.
In
contrast,
mutant
AP##C
gene
products
that
are
associated
with
at##ten##uated
p##oly##po##sis
(co##don
38##6
or
146##5)
interfere##d
only
weakly
with
wild-type
AP##C
activity.
These
results
suggest
a
molecular
explanation
for
the
g##eno##type-p##hen##otype
correlation
in
FA##P
patients
and
support
the
idea
that
color##ec##tal
tumor
growth
might
be,
in
part,
driven
by
selection
for
a
mutation
in
the
mutation
cluster
region..

from
which

A

results
from

We
identified
a
K##IT

mutation
in
a

This
mutation
results
in
a

within

This

was
found
to
be

at

with
a

Analysis
of
a
further
29
M##LD
patients
revealed
the
presence
of
five
additional
ho##mo##zy##got##es
for
T##27##4##M.
All
6
T##27##4##M
ho##mo##zy##got##es
(representing
four

were
of
Lebanese
descent,
and
all
were
known
to
be
the

The
altered
amino
acid
is
rigid##ly
conserved
among
10
su##lf##ata##ses
from
E##scher##ichi##a

to
humans;
therefore,
it
is
most
likely
that
the
result##ant

protein
will
have
little
or
no
enzyme
activity.
This
is
consistent
with

Recently,
the
gene
for
the
most
common
per##ox##is##oma##l
disorder,
X-linked
ad##ren##ole##uk##ody##stro##phy
(X-AL##D),
has
been
described
encoding
a
per##ox##is##oma##l
membrane
transport##er
protein.
We
analyzed
the
entire
protein-coding
sequence
of
this
gene
by
reverse-transcription
PC##R,
SS##CP,
and
DNA
se##quencing
in
five
patients
with
different
clinical
expression
of
X-AL##D
and
in
their
female
relatives;
these
clinical
expressions
were
cerebral
childhood
AL##D,
ad##ren##omy##elo##ne##uro##pathy
(AM##N),
and
"
Addison
disease
only
"
(AD##O)
p##hen##otype.
In
the
three
patients
exhibiting
the
classical
picture
of
severe
childhood
AL##D
we
identified
in
the
5
portion
of
the
X-AL##D
gene
a
38-b##p
del##eti##on
that
causes
a
frames##hi##ft
mutation,
a
3-b##p
del##eti##on
leading
to
a
del##eti##on
of
an
amino
acid
in
the
ATP-binding
domain
of
the
AL##D
protein,
and
a
miss##ense
mutation.
In
the
patient
with
the
clinical
p##hen##otype
of
AM##N,
a
nonsense
mutation
in
co##don
212,
along
with
a
second
site
mutation
at
co##don
178,
was
observed.
Analysis
of
the
patient
with
the
AD##O
p##hen##otype
revealed
a
further
miss##ense
mutation
at
a
highly
conserved
position
in
the
AL##DP/PM##P##70
comparison.
The
disrupt##ive
nature
of
two
mutations
(i.
e.,
the
frames##hi##ft
and
the
nonsense
mutation)
in
patients
with
bio##chemical##ly
proved
childhood
AL##D
and
AM##N
further
strongly
supports
the
hypothesis
that
alterations
in
this
gene
play
a
crucial
role
in
the
path##ogen##esis
of
X-AL##D.
Since
the
current
bio##chemical
techniques
for
X-AL##D
carrier
detection
in
affected
families
lack
sufficient
reliability,
our
procedure
described
for
systematic
mutation
scanning
is
also
capable
of
improving
genetic
counseling
and
pre##nat##al
diagnosis
At##elo##ste##ogen##esis

II
is
caused
by
mutations
in
the
di##ast##rop##hic
d##ys##p##lasia
su##lf##ate-transport##er
gene
(D##T##DS##T):
evidence
for
a
p##hen##otypic
series
involving
three
ch##ond##rod##ys##p##lasia##s.
At##elo##ste##ogen##esis

(A##O
II)
is

lethal
ch##ond##rod##ys##p##lasia
whose
clinical
and
his##to##logical
characteristics
resemble
those
of
another
ch##ond##rod##ys##p##lasia,
the
much
less
severe
di##ast##rop##hic
d##ys##p##lasia
(D##T##D).
The
similarity
suggests
a
shared
path##ogen##esis
involving
lesions
in
the
same
bio##chemical
pathway
and
perhaps
the
same
gene.
D##T##D
is
caused
by
mutations
in
the
recently
identified
di##ast##rop##hic
d##ys##p##lasia
su##lf##ate-transport##er
gene
(D##T##DS##T).
Here,
we
report
that
A##O##II
patients
also
have
D##T##DS##T
mutations,
which
lead
to
defect##ive
up##take
of
in##or##gan##ic
su##lf##ate
and
insufficient
su##lf##ation
of
mac##rom##ole##cule##s
by
patient
me##sen##chy##mal
cells
in
v##it##ro.
Together
with
our
recent
observation
that
a
third
even
more
severe
ch##ond##rod##ys##p##lasia,
a##cho##nd##rogen##esis
type
I##B,
is
also
caused
by
mutations
in
D##T##DS##T,
these
results
demonstrate
a
p##hen##otypic
series
of
three
ch##ond##rod##ys##p##lasia##s
of
increasing
severity
caused
by
lesions
in
a
single
su##lf##ate-transport##er
gene.
The
severity
of
the
p##hen##otype
appears
to
be
correlated
with
the
predicted
effect
of
the
mutations
on
the
residual
activity
of
the
D##T##DS##T
protein..
Em##eri##n,

of
which
causes
Emery-Dr##ei##fu##ss
muscular

is
localized
at
the
inner
nuclear
membrane.
X-linked
re##cess##ive
Emery-Dr##ei##fu##ss
muscular
d##ys##tro##phy
(E##DM##D)
is
an
inherited
muscle
disorder
characterized
by
the
clinical
t##riad
of
progressive
wasting
of
hum##ero-per##one##al
muscles,
early
contract##ures
of
the
elbows,
Achilles
tend##ons
and
post##cer##vic##al
muscles,
and
cardiac
conduct##ion
block
with
a
high
risk
of
sudden
death.
The
gene
for
E##DM##D
on
X##q##28
en##codes
a
novel
protein
named
em##eri##n
that
local##izes
at
the
nuclear
membrane
of
skeletal,
cardiac
and
smooth
muscles
and
some
other
non-muscle
tissues.
To
investigate
a
possible
physiological
role
for
em##eri##n,
we
examined
the
ultra##st##ructural
local##ization
of
the
protein
in
human
skeletal
muscle
and
He##L##a
cells,
using
ultra##thin
cry##ose##ctions.
We
found
that
the
immune-labeled
co##llo##idal
gold
particles
were
localized
on
the
n##uc##leo##p##las##mic
surface
of
the
inner
nuclear
membrane,
but
not
on
the
nuclear
p##ore.
Em##eri##n
stayed
on
the
c##yt##op##las##mic
surface
of
the
nuclear
la##mina,
even
after
de##ter##gent
treatment
that
so##lub##ilize##s
membrane
lip##ids
and
wash##es
out
membrane
proteins.
These
results
suggest
that
em##eri##n
anchor##s
at
the
inner
nuclear
membrane
through
the
h##ydro##phobic
stretch,
and
pro##tr##udes
from
the
h##ydro##phi##lic
region
to
the
n##uc##leo##p##las##m
where
it
interact##s
with
the
nuclear
la##mina.
We
s##pec##ulate
that
em##eri##n
contributes
to
maintain
the
nuclear
structure
and
stability,
as
well
as
nuclear
functions,
particularly
in
muscle
tissues
that
have
severe
stress
with
rigorous

I##dent##ification
of
a
common
P##EX##1
mutation
in
Z##ell##we##ger
syndrome.
The
Z##ell##we##ger
spectrum
of
disease,
encompassing
Z##ell##we##ger

and
the
progressively
mild##er
p##hen##otype##s
of
neon##ata##l
ad##ren##ole##uk##ody##stro##phy
and
infant##ile
Re##fs##um
disease,
is
due
to
a
failure
to
form
functional
per##ox##is##ome##s.
Cell
fusion
complement##ation
studies
demonstrated
that
these
diseases
are
genetically
he##tero##gene##ous,
with
two-thirds
of
all
patients
lying
within
a
single
complement##ation
group,
C##G##1.
Molecular
genetic
and
cell
biology
studies
have
shown
that
P##EX##1
is
def##icient
in
many
C##G##1
patients.
However,
previous
studies
have
focused
on
mildly
affected
patients
and
there
is
still
no
report
of
two
mutant
P##EX##1
all##ele##s
in
any
Z##ell##we##ger
syndrome
patient.
Furthermore,
mutations
in
the
PM##P##70
gene
have
also
been
identified
in
two
Z##ell##we##ger
syndrome
patients
from
C##G##1,
raising
the
possibility
that
C##G##1
patients
may
represent
a
mixture
of
P##EX##1-def##icient
and
PM##P##70-def##icient
individuals.
To
address
the
molecular
basis
of
disease
in
Z##ell##we##ger
syndrome
patients
from
C##G##1,
we
examined
all
24
P##EX##1
ex##ons
in
four
patients,
including
both
patients
that
have
mutations
in
PM##P##70.
P##EX##1
mutations
were
detected
in
all
four
patients,
including
a
1-b##p
insertion
(c.
209##7##ins##T)
in
ex##on
13
that
was
present
in
three
of
the
four
patients.
Subsequent
studies
demonstrated
that
this
mutation
is
present
in
one-half
of
all
C##G##1
patients
and
co##rrel##ates
with
the
Z##ell##we##ger
syndrome
p##hen##otype.
As
this
mutation
leads
to
a
loss
of
protein
function
its
frequency
makes
it
the
most
common
cause
of
Z##ell##we##ger
syndrome,
helping
to
explain
the
high
percentage
of
patients
that
belong
to
C##G##1.

Although
M##HC

including
H##LA-B##27,
contribute
only
20-50%
of

no

have
suggested
the

We
performed
a

Association
of

was
examined
by
both

Q##uant##itative

From
these

be

The

P##rade##r-Will##i

The

syndrome
involving

located
in

Four

allow
the

Moreover,

does
not
appear
to

Therefore,
the

in
this

remains
crucial
for
a
better
understanding
of
the
molecular

of
P##WS.
In

we
report
the

in
the

in

to
N##D##N/N##dn.
By

we
did
not
detect
any

but
by
R##T-PC##R

specific

was
detected
in

Multiple
origins
for
p##hen##yl##ket##on##uria
in
Europe.
Ph##en##yl##ket##on##uria
(P##K##U),
a
disorder
of
amino
acid
metabolism
prevalent
among
Caucasian##s
and
other
ethnic
groups,
is
caused
primarily
by
a
deficiency
of
the
he##pa##tic
enzyme
p##hen##yla##lani##ne
h##ydro##xy##lase
(PA##H).
P##K##U
is
a
highly
he##tero##gene##ous
disorder,
with
more
than
60
molecular
lesions
identified
in
the
PA##H
gene.
The
ha##p##lot##ype
associations,
relative
frequencies,
and
distributions
of
five
prevalent
PA##H
mutations
(R##15##8##Q,
R##26##1##Q,
IV##S##10##nt##5##46,
R##40##8##W,
and
IV##S##12##n##1)
were
established
in
a
comprehensive
European
sample
population
and
subsequently
were
examined
to
determine
the
potential
roles
of
several
genetic
mechanisms
in
explaining
the
present
distribution
of
the
major
P##K##U
all##ele##s.
Each
of
these
five
mutations
was
strongly
associated
with
only
one
of
the
more
than
70
ch##rom##oso##mal
ha##p##lot##ype##s
defined
by
eight
RF##LP##s
in
or
near
the
PA##H
gene.
These
findings
suggest
that
each
of
these
mutations
arose
through
a
single
founding
event
that
occurred
within
time
periods
ranging
from
several
hundred
to
several
thousand
years
ago.
From
the
significant
differences
observed
in
the
relative
frequencies
and
distributions
of
these
five
all##ele##s
throughout
Europe,
four
of
these
put##ative
founding
events
could
be
localized
to
specific
ethnic
subgroup##s.
Together,
these
data
suggest
that
there
were
multiple,
geographically
and
ethnic##ally
distinct
origins
for
P##K##U
within
the

To

the

we

In

The

suggest
that
the

may
give
rise
to

This
can
be
problematic
when
only

However,
the

as

the

was
not

The

(G##6##PD)
is
highly
p##oly##morphic;
more
than
300
G##6##PD

have
been

G##6##PD

to
have
arise##n
through
independent

but
within
the

it
may
also
be

One
example
is
the
island
of
Sardinia,
where
careful
clinical

have
identified
four
different
G##6##PD
variants.
We
clone##d
and

the

from
Sardinia
and
found
that
only
two
mutations
are
responsible
for
G##6##PD

in
this

one
mutation
is
the
cause
of
the
G##6##PD

a

the

for
the
17##q-linked

which
influences

in
five
of
eight
kind##red##s

The

include
an

a

insertion,
a

and
an

The
BR##CA##1
gene
is
expressed
in
numerous
tissues,
including
breast

and
en##codes
a
predicted

of
1863
amino

This

contains
a
zinc

in
its
amino-terminal

but
is

is
tightly

analysis
of

has
suggested
the

c##en-F##RD##A-D##9##S##5-D##9##S##15-q##ter.
We
report
here
the

of
a

to
D##9##S##5
and
the

In
order
to
map
these
markers
with
respect
to
the
F##RD##A
lo##cus,
all
within
a

we
sought
to
increase
the

families
by
considering
ho##mo##zy##gos##ity
by
descent
and
association
with
founder

in
isolated

This
approach
allowed
us
to
identify
one
phase-known
re##comb##ination
and
one
probable
historic
re##comb##ination
on
ha##p##lot##ype##s
from
Re##union
Island
patients,
both
of
which
place
three
of
the
five

to
F##RD##A.
This
represents
the
first
identification
of
close
F##RD##A
flank##ing
markers
on
the

The
two

allowed
us
to
narrow
the

of
a
previously
identified
di##stal
re##comb##ination
that
is
>
180
k##b
from
D##9##S##5
(26##P).
Take##n
together,
the
results
place
the
F##RD##A
lo##cus
in
a
450-k##b
interval,
which
is
small
enough
for

A

to

The

The

describes
further

of
the

by
means
of
a

that
span
approximately

in
the

centered
around
S##14##4

T##H##Y##1.
Location

indicate
that
three

segment,
as

as
three
con##ti##guous

are
each
unlikely
to
contain
the

while
the
more

is
most

These

together
with

Pro##life##ration-related

High
level
expression
of
the
nm##23-H##1
gene,
which
en##codes
for
a
n##uc##leo##side
dip##hos##phate
kinase,
has
been
found
to
co##rrel##ate
with
diminished
meta##sta##sis
in
some
tumors
but
not
in
others.
We
have
previously
identified
the
protein
product
of
the
nm##23-H##1
gene
in
two-dimensional
electro##ph##ore##tic
gel##s
and
have
designated
it
p##19/nm##23.
In
ne##uro##blast##oma,
higher
levels
of
p##19/nm##23,
which
are
associated
with
am##p##lification
of
the
N-my##c
on##co##gene,
large
tumor
mass,
and
meta##sta##sis,
were
observed
in
advanced
stage
tumors
compared
with
limited
stage
disease.
Because
of
the
variable
expression
of
nm##23-H##1
in
different
tumors,
we
have
investigated
the
relationship
between
amounts
of
the
protein
and
cell
proliferation.
The
levels
of
p##19/nm##23
were
compared
between
resting
and
mit##otic##ally
stimulate##d
normal
human
P##BL##s
and
in
le##uke##mia
cells.
The
amount
of
p##19/nm##23
increased
in
normal
l##ymph##ocytes
in
response
to
mit##otic
stimulation
and
parallel##ed
the
increase
in
DNA
synthesis.
In
le##uke##mia
cells
obtained
from
patients
with
different
sub##type##s
of
acute
le##uke##mia,
p##19/nm##23
levels
were
also
increased
relative
to
resting
normal
l##ymph##ocytes.
Treatment
of
mit##otic##ally
stimulate##d
l##ymph##ocytes
with
c##y##c##los##por##in,
which
in##hibit##s
proliferation,
blocked
the
increase
in
p##19/nm##23;
treatment
of
the
le##uke##mia
cell
line
H##L-60
with
dim##eth##yl##sul##fo##xi##de,
which
induce##s
terminal
differentiation,
resulted
in
diminished
levels
of
p##19/nm##23.
Our
data
therefore
provide
evidence
that

is
related
to

Auto##so##mal

mutation.
The
differential
diagnosis
of
the
genetic
bleeding
disorders,
hem##op##hil##ia
A
and
von
Will##eb##rand
disease,
is
occasionally
con##founded
by
the
close
molecular
relationship
of
co##agu##lation
factor
VIII
and
von
Will##eb##rand
factor
(v##W##F).
This
report
describes
the
auto##so##mal
inheritance
of
a
hem##op##hil##ia
A
p##hen##otype
due
to
a
mutation
of
v##W##F
that
results
in
defect##ive
factor
VIII
binding.
The
pro##band
was
a
female
patient
with
low
levels
of
factor
VIII
activity.
Pol##yme##rase
chain
reaction
(PC##R)
am##p##lification
and
DNA
se##quencing
were
employed
to
examine
ex##ons
encoding
the
put##ative
factor
VIII
binding
domain
of
v##W##F.
The
patient
was
found
to
be
ho##mo##zy##go##us
for
a
single
point
mutation
causing
a
T##hr--
>
Met
substitution
at
amino
acid
position
28
in
the
mature
v##W##F
subunit.
The
p##hen##otypic
expression
of
the
mutation
was
determined
to
be
re##cess##ive
because
he##tero##zy##go##us
family
members
were
clinical##ly
un##af##fected.
Re##comb##ina##nt
v##W##F
containing
the
observed
amino
acid
substitution
was
expressed
in
CO##S-1
cells.
The
mutant
v##W##F
was
processed
and
secret##ed
normally,
and
was
functional##ly
equivalent
to
wild-type
v##W##F
in
its
ability
to
bind
to
plate##lets.
However,
the
mutant
failed
to
bind
factor
VIII,
demonstrating
that
the
mutation
was
functional##ly
related
to
the
observed
hem##op##hil##ia
p##hen##otype.
The
family
we
describe
demonstrates
the
re##cess##ive
inheritance
of
a
recently
recognized
class
of
genetic
bleeding
disorders,
we
call
"
auto##so##mal
hem##op##hil##ia.
"
We
conclude
that
v##W##F
mutation
may
be
an
under
recognized
cause
of
hem##op##hil##ia,
especially
in
cases
where
the
inheritance
pattern
is
not
consistent
with
X-linked

X-linked
Ad##ren##ole##uk##ody##stro##phy
(X-AL##D)
is
the
most
frequent
per##ox##is##oma##l
disease.
It
mainly
involves
the
nervous
system
white
matter,
ad##rena##l
cortex
and
test##es.
Several
distinct
clinical
p##hen##otype##s
are
known.
The
principal

abnormal##ity
is
the
accumulation
of
saturated
very-long-chain
fatty

(V##LC##FA##s
>
C##22
0,
mainly
C##26

which
is
due
to
impaired
capacity
for
beta-oxidation
in
per##ox##is##ome##s.
Di##ag##nosis
is
usually
based
on
the
V##LC##FA
levels
in

in
both

In

of

however,
the

level
is

normal,
and
15%
of
o##b##liga##te
female
carriers
have
normal
results.
Effect##ive
mutation
detection
in
these
families
is
therefore
fundamental
to
un##am##bi##guous##ly
determine
the
genetic
status
of
each
individual
at
risk.
Of
particular
concern
are
female
members
of
kind##red##s
se##g##re##gating
X-AL##D
mutations,
because
normal
V##LC##FA
levels
do
not
guarantee
lack
of

status.
We
describe
a
fast
method
for
detection
of
X-AL##D
mutations.
The
method
is
based
on
SS##CP
analysis
of
nest##ed
PC##R
fragments
followed
by
sequence-determination
reactions.
Using
this
methodology
we
have
found
X-AL##D

were
identified
four
of
these
are

In

we
found
two

mutations,
one
of
which
changes
the
final
c##ys##tein##e
of
the

motif
to

These
data
are
consistent
with
a

model,
and
support
the
notion
that
this

is
in
fact
BR##CA##1.
The
he##tero##gene##ity
of
mutations,
coupled
with
the
large

indicates
that

In

whereby
the

line
(all
bilateral

or
in
a

(most

Most
bilateral
patients
have
no
family
history
of
re##tino##blast##oma
and
are
presumed
to
have
new
g##er##m##line
mutations
which
arose
in

We
have
determined
the

in
nine
re##tino##blast##oma

from
eight
unrelated
non-f##ami##lial

using
RB##1-linked
genetic

Six
t##umour##s
retained
the
paternal
all##ele
and
three
retained
the
maternal
all##ele.
Of
the
three
un##ila##teral
t##umour##s,
only
one
retained
the
paternal
RB##1
all##ele.
Thus,
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
paternal
RB##1

is
prefer##ential##ly
retained
in
re##tino##blast##oma,
as
has
been
suggested
to
be
the

By
contrast,
t##umour##s
from
four
of
the
five
bilateral

retained
the
paternal
RB##1

This
suggests
either
that
new

arise
more
frequently

The

female
transmission
bias.
We
further
examined
the
extent
and
causes
of
gene
loss
in
this
p##ed##ig##ree.
Gene
loss
in
the
patient
group
was
complete,
owing
to
in##fer##tility
of
the
male
patients
with
adult
onset
disease
and
the
fact
that
mentally
re##tar##ded
patients
did
not
pro##cre##ate.
Out
of
the
46
at
risk
subjects
in
the
two
youngest
generations,
only
one
was
found
to
have
a
full
mutation.
This
is
the
only
subject
who
may
transmit
the
gene
to
the
sixth
generation.
No
pro##tom##uta##tion
carriers
were
found
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
generations.
Therefore
it
is
highly
probable
that
the
D##M
gene
will
be
eliminated
from
this
p##ed##ig##ree
within
one
generation.
The
high
population
frequency
of
D##M
can
at
present
not
be
explained
by
the
contribution
of
as##ym##pt##oma##tic
cases
in
the
younger
generations
of
known
families,
but
is
probably
caused
by
the
events
in
the
ancestral
generations..

(D##MD)
is
an

for
which
the
bio##chemical

is
as

unknown.
Recently,
two

DNA
have
been
described
which
detect
structural
alterations
within

responsible
for
the
disorder.
Both
of
these
clone##d

were

and
were
capable
of

In

at

were
as##cer##tain##ed
by
R##T-PC##R

All

were
located
in
ex##ons
1-4.
Most
of
the
nonsense,

and
s##p##lice

were
found
in
ex##ons
6-11.
Mu##tations
that
alter

led
to
the
synthesis
of
several

a
fraction
of
which
represented
the

The
presence
of
normally

was
correlated
with

When
one
such
case
was
studied
by

reduced
amounts
of

present.
In

cases
as

was
found
between
the
amount
of

present
and
the

G##6##PD
Or##issa
(44
Al##a-->G##ly),
is
the
major
p##oly##morphic
variant
in
tribal
populations
in
India.
De##ficiency
of
glucose-6-phosphate
de##hy##dr##ogen##ase
(G##6##PD)
is
usually
found
at
high
frequencies
in
areas
of
the
world
where
malaria
has
been
endemic.
The
frequency
and
genetic
basis
of
G##6##PD
deficiency
have
been
studied
in
Africa,
around
the
Mediterranean,
and
in
the
Far
East,
but
little
such
information
is
available
about
the
situation
in
India.
To
determine
the
extent
of
he##tero##gene##ity
of
G##6##PD,
we
have
studied
several
different
Indian
populations
by
screening
for
G##6##PD
deficiency,
followed
by
molecular
analysis
of
def##icient
all##ele##s.
The
frequency
of
G##6##PD
deficiency
varies
between
3%
and
15%
in
different
tribal
and
urban
groups.
Re##mark##ably,
a
previously
un##re##port##ed
def##icient
variant,
G##6##PD
Or##issa
(44
Al##a--

G##ly),
is
responsible
for
most
of
the
G##6##PD
deficiency
in
tribal
Indian
populations
but
is
not
found
in
urban
populations,
where
most
of
the
G##6##PD
deficiency
is
due
to
the
G##6##PD
Mediterranean
(188

Ph##e)
variant.
The
K##m##NA##DP
of
G##6##PD
Or##issa
is
five##fold
higher
than
that
of
the
normal
enzyme.
This
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
the
al##ani##ne
residue
that
is
replaced
by
g##ly##cine
is
part
of

were
found.
Nine
of
these

are
found
within

(zinc

the
remaining

is
in

These

In

Using

In

Mu##tations
in

account
for

The
loss
of

BR##CA##1
in
t##umour##s
of
individuals
carrying
one

suggests
that

en##codes
a

that
may
in##hibit
the

To
examine
the

in

growth
and
differentiation,
and
to
generate
a
potential
model
for
the

with
loss
of
BR##CA##1
function,
we
have
created
a
mouse

carrying
a
mutation
in
one
B##rca##1
all##ele.
Analysis
of
mice
ho##mo##zy##go##us
for
the
mutant
all##ele
indicate
that
B##rca##1
is
critical
for
normal
development,
as
these
mice
died
in
u##tero
between
10
and

In

increased

and
a

ma##rrow.
There
was
no
clinical
and
laboratory
evidence
of
any
significant
im##mu##nological
abnormal##ities.
Similar
findings
in
two
other
brothers
suggested
strongly
that
they
were
all
suffering
from
an
X

re##cess##ive
th##rom##bo##cy##top##eni##c
disorder.
Results
of
DNA
analysis
with
the
probe
M##27
beta
are
consistent
with
X
link##age
and
indicate
also
that
the
lo##cus
of
the
relevant

lies
close
to
or
is
identical
to
the
lo##cus
of
the
gene
for
the
W##isk##ott-Al##dric##h
syndrome
(WA##S).
Because
of
various
features
which
include
the
presence
of
large
and
normal
sized
plate##lets
(rather
than
small
plate##lets)
and
freedom
from
significant
immune
def##ici##encies,
it
is
likely
that
the
X
linked
re##cess##ive
th##rom##bo##cy##top##enia
in
this
family
is
an
isolated
entity
quite
distinct
from
the
classical
WA##S
p##hen##otype.
However,
a
modified
expression
of
the
WA##S
gene
producing
a
mild
p##hen##otypic
variant
cannot
be
excluded
entirely..

affected
with
c##ere##bro##tend##ino##us
x##ant##hom##ato##sis
(CT##X).
All
are

In

of
the
small
number
of
CT##X
patients
diagnosed
in
the
world
(a
total
of
50
including
our
6
patients),
we
are
probably
dealing
with
an
ethnic
subgroup
with
a
high
CT##X

frequency,
which
we
have
estimated
to
be

Sub##jects

in

We
describe
two
pro##band##s
with
a
CE##TP

(44##2
D

Although
he##tero##zy##go##us,
they
have
three##fold
increases
in
HD##L
concentration
and
marked##ly
decreased
plasma
CE##TP
mass
and
activity,
suggesting
that
the
mutation
has
dominant
effects
on
CE##TP
and
HD##L
in
v##ivo.
Cell##ular
expression
of
mutant
c##D##NA
results
in
secret##ion
of

30%
of

Moreover,
co##ex##press##ion
of
wild

leads
to

of
wild

The
dominant
effects
of
the
CE##TP

during
cellular
expression
probably
explains
why
the
pro##band##s
have
marked##ly
increased
HD##L
in

suggests
that

suggesting
that

Thus,
the

X-linked
ne##uro##log##ic
disorder
of
my##elin
metabolism
with
a
novel
mutation
in
the
gene
encoding
pro##te##oli##pid
protein.
The
no##sol##ogy
of
the
in##born
errors
of
my##elin
metabolism
has
been
s##ty##mie##d
by
the
lack
of
molecular
genetic
analysis.
Historically,
P##eli##za##eus-Me##rz##bach##er
disease
has
encompassed
a
host
of
ne##uro##log##ic
disorders
that
present
with
a
deficit
of
my##elin,
the
membrane
elaborate##d
by
g##lial
cells
that
en##ci##rcle##s
and
successively
en##w##rap##s
a##xon##s.
We
describe
here
a
P##eli##za##eus-Me##rz##bach##er
p##ed##ig##ree
of
the
classical
type,
with
X-linked
inheritance,
a
typical
clinical
progression,
and
a
path##olo##gic
loss
of
my##elin##ating
cells
and
my##elin
in
the
central
nervous
system.
To
disc##rim##inate
variants
of
P##eli##za##eus-Me##rz##bach##er
disease,
a
set
of
o##li##gon##uc##leo##tide
prime##rs
was
constructed
to
polymer##ase-chain-reaction
(PC##R)
am##p##lify
and
sequence
the
gene
encoding
pro##te##oli##pid
protein
(P##LP),
a
structural
protein
that
comprises
half
of
the
protein
of
the
my##elin
sheath.
The
P##LP
gene
in
one
of
two
affected
males
and
the
carrier
mother
of
this
family
exhibited
a
single
base
difference
in
the
more
than
2
k##b
of
the
P##LP
gene
sequence##d,
a
C----T
transition
that
would
create
a
se##rine
substitution
for
pro##line
at
the
car##box##y
end
of
the
protein.
Our
results
del##ine##ate
the
clinical
features
of
P##eli##za##eus-Me##rz##bach##er
disease,
define
the
possible
molecular
path##ology
of
this
d##ys##my##elin##ating
disorder,
and
address
the
molecular
classification
of
in##born
errors
of
my##elin
metabolism.
Pat##ients
with
the
classical
form
(type
I)
and
the
more
severely
affected,
con##nat##al

of
P##eli##za##eus-Me##rz##bach##er
disease
(type
II)
would
be
predicted
to
display
mutation
at
the
P##LP
lo##cus.
The
other
variants
(types
III-VI),
which
have
sometimes
been
categorized
as
P##eli##za##eus-Me##rz##bach##er
disease,
may
represent

CA##G
expansion##s
in
a
novel
gene
for
Mac##had##o-Joseph
disease
at
chromosome
14##q##32.1.
We
have
identified
a
novel
gene
containing
CA##G
repeats
and
mapped
it
to
chromosome
14##q##32.
1,
the
genetic
lo##cus
for
Mac##had##o-Joseph
disease
(M##J##D).
In
normal
individuals
the
gene
contains
between
13
and
36
CA##G
repeats,
whereas
most
of
the
clinical##ly
diagnosed
patients
and
all
of
the
affected
members
of
a
family
with
the
clinical
and
path##ological
diagnosis
of
M##J##D
show
expansion
of
the
repeat-number
(from
68-79).
Southern
b##lot
analyses
and
g##eno##mic
c##lon##ing
demonstrates
the
existence
of
related
genes.
These
results
raise
the
possibility
that
similar
abnormal##ities
in
related
genes
may
give
rise
to
diseases
similar
to
M##J##D.
Conservation
of

gene
in

A
portion
of
the
Du##chen##ne
muscular
d##ys##tro##phy
(D##MD)
gene
trans##cript
from
human
f##etal
skeletal
muscle
and
mouse
adult

was
sequence##d,
representing
approximately
25
percent
of
the

The
nuclei##c
acid
and
predicted
amino
acid
sequences
from
the
two

are
nearly
90
percent
ho##mo##log##ous.
The
amino
acid
sequence
that
is
predicted
from
this
portion
of
the
D##MD
gene
indicates
that
the
protein
product
might
serve
a
structural
role
in
muscle,
but
the
abundance
and
tissue
distribution
of
the
messenger
RNA
suggests
that
the
D##MD
protein
is
not

in

To
as##cer##tain
the
molecular
mechanism
that
causes
m##uri##ne
C##5

g##eno##mic
and
c##D##NA
libraries
were
constructed
from

D##2/o##S##n##J
that
are
sufficient
and

respectively.
Gen##omi##c

were
isolated
which
correspond
to
P##vu##II
and
Hi##nd##II##I
restriction
fragment
length
p##oly##mor##phism##s
associated
with
C##5
deficiency.
Se##quence
analyses
demonstrated
that
each
of
these
p##oly##mor##phism##s
resulted
from
single
base
pair
substitution##s
and
that
neither
substitution
would
probably
cause
or
contribute
to
the
C##5
deficiency.
Se##quence
analyses
of
C##5
sufficient
and
def##icient
c##D##NA##s
revealed
a
2
base-pair
del##eti##on
in
the
def##icient
c##D##NA##s.
The
"
T##A
"
del##eti##on
was
located
near
the
5
end
of
the
c##D##NA.
This
del##eti##on
shifts
the
reading
frame
of
the
C##5
m##RNA
so
that
the
termination
co##don
U##GA
is
present
4
base

downstream
from
the

was
am##plified
and
sequence##d
corresponding
to
the

surrounding
the
2-base

Six
C##5-def##icient

Ba##l##b/C##J,
C##5##7##B##l/6##J,
DB##A/1##J,
and
B##10.
D##2/n##S##n##J,
were
analyzed.
The
se##quencing
data
revealed
that
the
2
base
pairs
were
deleted
from
the
C##5
gene
of
each
def##icient
mouse
tested
but
not
from
the
C##5
gene
of
any
sufficient
mouse.
These
data
demonstrate
that
1)
there
is
an
identical
2-base
pair
del##eti##on
in
an
ex##on
of
the
C##5
gene
in
several
different
C##5-def##icient
mouse
strains;
2)
the
m##RNA
trans##cribed
from
the
C##5##D
gene
retains
this
del##eti##on;
and
3)
this
mutation
should
result
in
C##5

C##9
component
of

First
case
of
C##9
deficiency
in
Europe.
We
describe
the
first
cases,
to
our
knowledge,
of
C##9
deficiency
in
Europe
that
were
detected
in
a
Swiss
family,
of
which
two
members--one
with
a
complete
deficiency
and
the
other
with
approximately
half-normal
C##9
levels--experienced
bacterial
men##ing##itis.
The

patient,
a
56-year-old
white
man
with
a
history
of
pu##ru##lent
men##ing##itis
at
the
age
of
23
years,
presented
with
an
acute
men##ing##oc##oc##cal
men##ing##itis.
No
imp##air##ment
of
cellular

or
im##mu##no##g##lo##bul##in

could
be
found.
Co##mple##ment
ass##ays
showed
a
complete

of
the
C##9
component,
while
the
other
individual
component
levels
were
normal
and
the
hem##oly##tic
activity
(measured
using
the
CH##50
ass##ay)
was
only
slightly
reduced.
A
family
study
revealed
complete

in
the

healthy

and
half-normal
C##9
concentrations
in
his
sister,
his

(who
also
had
experienced
an
episode
of
bacterial
men##ing##itis),
and
his
niece,
consistent
with
an
inherited
C##9
deficiency.
This
first
case
of
re##current
men##ing##itis
in
a
white
patient
with
complete
C##9

suggests
that
this

may
also
be
a

(B##MT)
from
a

was
performed
in
a
13-year-old

with
rapidly
progressive
ad##ren##ole##uk##ody##stro##phy
(AL##D).
En##gra##ft##ment
and

occurred
within

continued.
The

died
of
an

after
B##MT.
AL##D
is
characterized
by
abnormal##ly
high
plasma
levels
of
very
long
chain
fatty

(V##LC##FA)
as
a
result
of

them.
Ten
days
after
B##MT,
the
white

after
3
months,
there
was
progressive

Inc##reased

G##lu##cos##e-6-phosphate
de##hy##dr##ogen##ase
(G##6##PD)
deficiency
in
RB##Cs
was
found
significantly
more
frequently
in
210
male
cat##ara##ct##ous
patients
than
in
67##2
control
subjects
of
Sardinia##n
origin.
The
frequency
of
the
deficiency
was
increasingly
higher
in
pre##sen##ile
cat##ara##cts.
In
the
G##6##PD-def##icient
group,
the
incidence
of
co##rt##ical
and
total
cat##ara##cts
was
also
increased.
It
is
suggested
that
decrease
of
the
G##6##PD
activity
in
the
lens,
which
a##cco##mp##ani##es
its
deficiency
in
the
er##yt##hr##oc##yte,
might
play
a
role
in
the
cat##ara##ct##o-genes##is
of
these
patients.
Moreover,
G##6##PD
deficiency
should
be
added
to
other
conditions,
such
as
the
gal##act##ose##mic
states
and
rib##of##lav##in

Von
Hip##pel-Linda##u
disease
maps
to
the
region
of
chromosome
3
associated
with
re##nal
cell
car##cin##oma.
Von
Hip##pel-Linda##u
disease
(V##HL)
is
an
auto##so##mal
dominant
disorder
with
inherited
su##s##ce##pt##ibility
to
various
forms
of
cancer,
including
hem##ang##io##blast##oma##s
of
the
central
nervous
system,
p##ha##eo##ch##rom##oc##yt##oma##s,
pan##cre##atic
ma##li##gna##ncies,
and
re##nal
cell
car##cin##oma##s.
Ren##al
cell
car##cin##oma##s
constitute
a
particularly
frequent
cause
of
death
in
this
disorder,
occurring
as
bilateral
and
multi##fo##cal
t##umour##s,
and
presenting
at
an
earlier
age
than
in
s##poradic,
non-f##ami##lial
cases
of
this
t##umour
type.
We
report
here
that
the
V##HL
gene
is
linked
to
the
lo##cus
encoding
the
human
ho##mo##log##ou##e
of
the
RAF##1
on##co##gene,
which
maps
to
chromosome
3##p##25
(re##f.
4).
Cross##overs
with
the
V##HL
lo##cus
suggest
that
the
defect
responsible
for
the
V##HL
p##hen##otype
is
not
a
mutation
in
the
RAF##1
gene
itself.
An
alternative
or
prior
event
to
on##co##gene
activation
in
t##umour
formation
may
be
the
in##act##ivation
of
a
put##ative
t##umour
suppress##or
which
can
be
associated
with
both
the
inherited
and
s##poradic
forms
of
the
cancer.
S##poradic
re##nal
cell
car##cin##oma##s
have
previously
been
associated
with
the
loss
of
regions
on
chromosome
3##p
(re##fs
5,
6).
Consequently,
s##poradic
and
V##HL-associated
forms
of
re##nal
cell
car##cin##oma
might
both
result
from
alterations
causing
loss
of
function
of
the
same
t##umour
suppress##or
gene
on
this
chromosome..
T##ight##ly

flank##ing
markers
for
the
Lowe
o##cu##loc##ere##bro##rena##l
syndrome,
with
application
to
carrier
assessment.
The
Lowe
o##cu##loc##ere##bro##rena##l
syndrome
(O##CR##L)
is
characterized
by
con##gen##ital
cat##ara##ct,
mental
re##tar##dation,
and
defect##ive
re##nal
tub##ular
function.
A
map
assignment
of
O##CR##L
to
X##q##24-q##26
has
been
made
previously
by
link##age
analysis
with
D##X##S##42
at
X##q##24-q##26
(the##ta
=
0,
z
=

09)
and
with
D##X##S##10
at
X##q##26
(the##ta
=
0,
z
=
6.
45).
Two
additional
families
were
studied
and
three
additional
p##oly##mor##phism##s
were
identified
at
D##X##S##42
by
using
a
35-k##b
sequence
isolated
with
the
probe
detect##ing
the
original
p##oly##mor##phism
at
D##X##S##42.
With
additional
O##CR##L
families
made
inform##ative
for
D##X##S##42,
the##ta
remained
0
with
z
=
6.
63;
and
for
D##X##S##10
the##ta
=
0.
03
and
z
=
7.
07.
Evidence
for
placing
O##CR##L
at
X##q##25
also
comes
from
a
female
with
Lowe
syndrome
and
an
X;
3
trans##location.
We
have
used
the
X##q##25
break##point
in
this
patient
to
determine
the
position
of
O##CR##L
relative
to
the
two
linked
markers.
Each
derivative
chromosome
was
isolated
away
from
its
normal
counterpart
in
so##matic
cell
hybrid##s.
D##X##S##42
was
mapped
to
the
derivative
chromosome
X
containing
X##pt##er##q##25,
and
D##X##S##10
was
mapped
to
the
derivative
chromosome
3
containing
X##q##25-q##ter.
The
markers
D##X##S##10
and
D##X##S##42
therefore
show
tight
link##age
with
O##CR##L
in
six
families
and
flank
the
X##q##25
break##point
in
a
female
patient
with
an
X;

trans##location.
Link##age
analysis
with
flank##ing
markers
was
used
to
assess
O##CR##L
carrier
status
in
women
at
risk.
Results,
when
compared
with
carrier

Motor

immune
def##ici##encies,
and
an
increased
risk
of
cancer
are
the
characteristic
features
of
the
hereditary
disease
at##ax##ia-te##lang##ie##ct##asi##a
(A-T),
which
is
caused
by
mutations
in
the
AT##M
gene.
Through
gene
targeting,
we
have
generated
a
line
of
At##m
mutant
mice,
At##m
(y/y)
mice.
In
contrast
to
other
At##m
mutant
mice,
At##m
(y/y)
mice
show
a
lower
incidence
of
thy##mic
l##ymph##oma
and
survive
beyond
a
few
months
of
age.
At##m
(y/y)
mice
exhibit
deficit##s
in
motor
learning
in##dicative
of
c##ere##bella##r
d##ys##function.
Even
though
we
found
no
gross
c##ere##bella##r
de##gene##ration
in
older
At##m
(y/y)
animals,
e##ct##op##ic
and
abnormal##ly
differentiated
P##ur##kin##je
cells
were
apparent
in
mutant
mice
of
all
ages.
These
findings
establish
that
some
ne##uro##path##ological
abnormal##ities
seen
in
A-T
patients
also
are
present
in
At##m
mutant
mice.
In
addition,
we
report

un##re##co##gni##zed
effect
of
At##m
deficiency
on
development
or

of

We
discuss
these
findings
in
the
context
of
the
hypothesis
that
abnormal
development
of
P##ur##kin##je
cells
and
l##ymph##ocytes
contributes
to
the
path##ogen##esis
of
A-T..
Both
mutations
in
G##6##PD
A-
are
necessary
to
produce
the
G##6##PD
def##icient
p##hen##otype.
The
high
prevalence
of
glucose
6-phosphate
de##hy##dr##ogen##ase
(G##6##PD)
deficiency
in
African
populations
is
due
almost
entirely
to
the
enzyme
variant
A-,
which
differs
from
the
wild-type
G##6##PD
B
by
two
amino
acid
replacement##s,
68
Val--

Met
and
126
As##n--

As##p.
The
non-def##icient
p##oly##morphic
variant
G##6##PD
A
contains
only
the
mutation
126
As##n--

As##p.
The
frequencies
of
the
G##6##PD
A
and
of
the
G##6##PD
A-
genes
in
parts
of
Africa
are
both
about
0.
2.
The
68
Val--
>
Met
mutation
has
not
been
found
in
a
B
background.
This
could
be
because
the
68
Val--
>
Met
mutation
happened
to
arise
in
an
A
gene
in
the
first
instance,
or
because
the
68
Val--
>
Met
mutation
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
cause
G##6##PD
deficiency.
We
have
approached
this
question
by
producing
G##6##PD
B,
A,
A-,
and
G##6##PD
68
Val--
>
Met
in
a
bacterial
expression
system
and
anal##ys##ing
their
bio##chemical
properties.
With
each
single
mutation
we
found
a
slight
decrease
in
both
the
specific
activity
and
the
yield
of
enzyme
when
compared
to
G##6##PD
B.
When
both
mutations
were
introduced
together,
there

This

We
in##fer
that
the

of

is

We

that
can
be

plus
the

of
the

in
a

(PC##R).
When
used
in
conjunction
with
an
existing
prime##r
set,
these
two

detect
about
98%
of
del##eti##ons
in
patients
with
Du##chen##ne

Furthermore,
these

in

allowing

of

on

Thus,

AT##M,
spans
about
150

of
g##eno##mic
DNA.
AT##M
mutations
are
found
along
the
entire

with
no
evidence
of

Using
DNA
as
the
starting
material,
we
screened
the
AT##M
gene
in
92
A-T
patients,
using
an
op##ti##mized
single-strand

(SS##CP)
technique
that
detected
all
previously
known
mutations
in

To

we
se##quential##ly
loaded
the

with
three
different
sets
of
PC##R

that
were
pre##test##ed
to
avoid
overlapping

Many
of
the
DNA
changes
we
detected
were
in##tra##genic
p##oly##mor##phism##s.
Of
an
expected
177
unknown
mutations,
we
detected
approximately
70%,
mostly
protein

mutations
(that
would
have
been
detect##able
by

if

material
had
been
available).
Mu##tations
have
now
been
defined
for

Here##in,
we

P##rade##r-Will##i
syndrome
(P##WS)
and
Angel##man
syndrome
(AS)
are
distinct
ne##uro##be##ha##vior##al
disorders
that
most
often
arise
from
a
4-M##b
del##eti##on
of
chromosome
15##q##11-q##13
during
paternal
or

game##to##genesis,
respectively.
At
a

frequency
of
approximately.
67-1/10,

these

represent
a
common

in
the

To
el##uc##ida##te
the
mechanism
underlying
these
events,
we
characterized
the
regions
that
contain
two
pro##ximal
break##point
clusters
and
a
di##stal

Novel

potentially
associated

The

has
been

(17

and

the

We
have

breast

with
eight
p##oly##mor##phism##s
from
the

including
two
in
the
E##D##H1##7##B##2
gene.
Gene##tic
re##comb##ination
with
the
breast

trait
exclude##s
RA##RA
from
further
consideration
as
a
candidate
gene
for
BR##CA##1.
Both
BR##CA##1
and
E##D##H1##7##B##2
map
to
a
6
c##M
interval
(between
T##H##RA##1
and
D##17##S##5##7##9)
and
no
re##comb##ination
was
observed
between
the
two

However,
direct
se##quencing
of

containing
the

in
four

Mu##tations
in

therefore
do
not
appear
to
be
responsible
for
the
hereditary

Single

My##oto##nic
d##ys##tro##phy:
evidence
for
a
possible
dominant-negative
RNA
mutation.
The
t##rin##uc##leo##tide
expansion
mutation
causing
my##oto##nic
d##ys##tro##phy
is
in
the
3
un##tra##ns##lated
region
of
a
protein
kinase
gene.
The
molecular
mechanisms
by
which
the
expanded
repeat
causes
the
clinical##ly
variable
and
multi##sy##ste##mic
disease,
my##oto##nic
d##ys##tro##phy,
are
not
understood.
It
has
been
particularly
difficult
to
rational##ize
the
dominant
inheritance
with
the
fact
that
the
expansion
mutation
lies
outside
of
the
protein-encoding
gene
elements,
and
should
not
be
translated
into
protein.
Here
we
use
muscle
bio##ps##ies
from
classical
adult-onset
my##oto##nic
d##ys##tro##phy
patients
to
study
the
accumulation
of
trans##cripts
from
both
the
normal
and
expanded
D##M
kinase
genes
in
patient
muscle,
and
compare
the
results
to
normal
and
my##op##ath##ic
controls.
We
found
relatively
small
decreases
of
D##M
kinase
RNA
in
the
total
RNA
pool
from
muscle;
however,
these
reduction##s
were
not
disease
specific.
Analysis
of
p##oly
(A)
+
RNA
showed
dramatic
decreases
of
both
the
mutant
and
normal
D##M
kinase
RNA##s,
and
these
changes
were
disease-specific.
Our
findings
are
consistent
with
a
novel
molecular
path##ogen##etic
mechanism
for
my##oto##nic
d##ys##tro##phy
both
the
normal
and
expanded
D##M
kinase
genes
are
trans##cribed
in
patient
muscle,
but
the
abnormal
expansion-containing
RNA
has
a
dominant
effect
on
RNA
metabolism
by
preventing
the
accumulation
of
p##oly
(A)
+
RNA.
The
ability
of
the
expansion
mutation
to
alter
accumulation
of
p##oly
(A)
+
RNA
in
trans
suggests
that
my##oto##nic
d##ys##tro##phy
may
be
the
first
example
of
a
dominant-negative
mutation
manifest##ed
at
the

level..
Is##ola##tion

an
X-linked
multi##sy##ste##m

characterized
by
abnormal##ities
in
the

We
have
assembled
a

A

was
detected
by
screening
DNA
from
patients
with
radio##la##bel##ed
whole

and
two

were
identified
within
this
del##eti##on.
The
m##RNA
expression
pattern
of
one
of
them,
designated
as
X##K,
co##rrel##ates
closely
to
the
M##c##Leod

X##K
en##codes
a

at

These

provide
direct

that
X##K
is

Miss##ense
mutation
in
the
alternative

of
the
PA##X##6
gene
in

The
PA##X##6
gene
is
involved
in
o##cular
m##or##ph##ogen##esis,
and
PA##X##6

have
been
detected
in

The
gene
en##codes
a
transcription##al
regulator
that
recognizes
target
genes
through
its
paired-type
DNA-binding
domain.
The
paired
domain
is
composed
of
two
distinct
DNA-binding
sub##dom##ain##s,
the
N-terminal
sub##dom##ain
(N##TS)
and
the
C-terminal
sub##dom##ain
(CT##S),
which
bind
respective
consensus
DNA
sequences.
The
human
PA##X##6
gene
produces
two
alternative
s##p##lice
is##of##orms
that
have
the
distinct

of
the
paired
domain.
The
insertion,
into
the
N##TS,
of

encoded
by

a##bol##ishes
the

the

Thus,

and
neon##ata##l
feeding
difficulties
followed
by
h##yper##pha##gia,
leading
to
profound

P##WS
is
due
to
a
lack
of
paternal
genetic
information
at
15##q##11-q##13
(re##f.

Five

as

as

designated
PA##R-1

PA##R-5
(re##f.

I##mp##rin##ting
of

involves
a

appears
to
imp##air
the

of
the

in

and
leads
to
P##WS.
Here

report
a

in
which
the
father
is
mosaic
for
an

The

Molecular

two
gal##act##ose##mia
mutations:
correlation
of
mutations
with
highly

u##rid##yl
transfer##ase.
Gala##ct##ose##mia
is
an

of
human
gal##act##ose
metabolism
caused
by
deficiency
of
the
enzyme
gal##act##ose-1-phosphate
u##rid##yl
transfer##ase
(GA##LT).
The
molecular
basis
of
this
disorder
is
at
present
not
well
understood.
We
report
here
two
miss##ense
mutations
which
result
in
low
or
und##ete##ct##able
en##zy##matic
activity.
First,
we
identified
at
n##uc##leo##tide
59##1
a
transition
which
substitute##s
g##lut##amine
188
by
a##rg##ini##ne.
The
m##uta##ted
g##lut##amine
is
not
only
highly
conserved
in
evolution
(conserved
also
in
E##scher##ichi##a
co##li
and
Sa##cc##har##omy##ces
c##ere##vis##iae),
but
is
also
two
amino
acid
residues
downstream
from
the
active
site
his##ti##dine-pro##line-his##ti##dine
t##riad
and
results
in
about
10%
of
normal
en##zy##matic
activity.
The
a##rg##ini##ne
188
mutation
is
the
most
common
gal##act##ose##mia
mutation
characterized
to
date.
It
accounts
for
one-fourth
of
the
gal##act##ose##mia
all##ele##s
studied.
Second,
we
report
the
substitution
of
a##rg##ini##ne
333
by
try##pt##op##han,
caused
by
a
transition
at
n##uc##leo##tide
102##5.
The
area
surrounding
this
miss##ense
mutation
is
the
most
highly
conserved
domain
in
the
ho##mo##log##ous
enzymes
from
E.
co##li,
yeast,
and
humans,
and
this
mutation
results
in
und##ete##ct##able
en##zy##matic
activity,
suggesting
that
this
is
a
severe
mutation.
This
second
mutation
appears
to
be
rare,
since
it
was
found
only
in
the
patient
we
sequence##d.
Our

provide
further
evidence
for
the

evidence
of

lesions.
Moreover,
in
patients
without
clear
signs
of
inflammatory
damage,
this
treatment
does
not
modify
significantly
the
natural
course
of
the
disease.
However,
because
effective
treatments
should
begin
before
the
onset
of
severe
ne##uro##log##ic
symptoms,
SE##Ps
and
ME##Ps
should
be
considered
to

the

of
other

The
molecular
basis
of
S##jo##gren-Lars##son
syndrome:
mutation
analysis
of
the
fatty
al##de##hy##de
de##hy##dr##ogen##ase
gene.
S##jo##gren-Lars##son
syndrome
(SL##S)
is
an
auto##so##mal
re##cess##ive
disorder
characterized
by
i##cht##hy##osis,
mental
re##tar##dation,
spa##stic##ity,
and
def##icient
activity
of
fatty
al##de##hy##de
de##hy##dr##ogen##ase
(FA##LD##H).
To
define
the
molecular
defects
causing
SL##S,
we
performed
mutation
analysis
of
the
FA##LD##H
gene
in
pro##band##s
from
63
kind##red##s
with
SL##S.
Among
these
patients,
49
different
mutations-including
10
del##eti##ons,
2
insertion##s,
22
amino
acid
substitution##s,
3
nonsense
mutations,
9
s##p##lice-site
defects,
and
3
complex
mutations-were
found.
All
of
the
patients
with
SL##S
were
found
to
carry
mutations.
Nine##teen
of
the
miss##ense
mutations
resulted
in
a
severe
reduction
of
FA##LD##H
enzyme
cat##alytic
activity
when
expressed
in
ma##mmal##ian
cells,
but
one
mutation
(79##8##G--
>
C
[K##26##6##N])
seemed
to
have
a
greater
effect
on
m##RNA
stability.
The
s##p##lice-site
mutations
led
to
ex##on
skip##ping
or
u##til##ization
of
cry##ptic
accept##or-s##p##lice
sites.
Thirty-seven
mutations
were
private,
and
12
mutations
were
seen
in
two
or
more
pro##band##s
of
European
or
Middle
Eastern
descent.
Four
single-n##uc##leo##tide
p##oly##mor##phism##s
(S##NP##s)
were
found
in
the
FA##LD##H
gene.
At
least
four
of
the
common
mutations
(55##1##C--
>
T,
68##2##C--
>
T,
73##3##G--
>
A,
and
79##8
+
1##del##G)
were
associated
with
multiple
S##NP
ha##p##lot##ype##s,
suggesting
that
these
mutations
originated
independently
on
more
than
one
occasion
or
were
ancient
SL##S
genes
that
had
undergone
in##tra##genic
re##comb##ination.
Our
results
demonstrate
that
SL##S
is
caused
by
a
striking##ly
he##tero##gene##ous
group
of
mutations
in
the
FA##LD##H
gene
and
provide
a
framework
for
understanding
the
genetic
basis
of
SL##S
and
the
development
of
DNA-based
diagnostic
tests..

Molecular,

were
carried
out
on

in
a

G##6##PD

and
was
about
2%
of

le##uk##ocytes.
Molecular
studies
using
standard
methods
(WHO,
1967)
showed
G##6##PD
in
the

to
have
a
slightly

Other

showed
the

The
molecular
characteristics
of
G##6##PD
in
the
patient
differed
from
those
of
all
previously
reported
variants
associated
with
C##NS##HA,
so
the
present
variant
was
provisional##ly
called
G##6##PD

to
distinguish
it
from
other
G##6##PD

previously
described.

for
the

of
G##6##PD
in

was
investigated
by

In
Swedish
families
with
hereditary
pro##state
cancer,
link##age
to
the
HP##C##1
lo##cus
on
chromosome
1##q##24-25
is
restricted
to
families
with

Pro##state

clusters
in
some
families,
and
an
estimated
5%
-10%
of
all
cases
are
estimated
to
result
from
inheritance
of
pro##state

genes.
We
previously
reported
evidence
of
link##age
to
the
1##q##24-25
region
(HP##C##1)
in
91
North
American
and
Swedish
families
each
with
multiple
cases
of
pro##state
cancer
(Smith
et
al.
1996).
In
the
present
report
we
analyze
40
(12
original
and
28
newly
identified)
Swedish
families
with
hereditary
pro##state
cancer
(HP##C)
that,
on
the
basis
of
40
markers
spanning
a
25-c##M
interval
within
1##q##24-25,
have
evidence
of
link##age.
In
the
complete
set
of
families,
a
maximum
two-point
L##OD

was
observed
at
D##1##S##41##3
(at

Z

at
D##1##S##20##2
(P

The
evidence
of
link##age
to
this
region
originated
almost
exclusively
from
the
subset
of
12
early-onset
(age
<
65

families,
which
yielded
a
maximum
L##OD

and
an

95
at
D##1##S##42##2
(P

E##st##imate##s
from

tests
suggest
that,
within
Sweden,
as
many
as
50%
of
early-onset
families
had
evidence
of
link##age
to
the
HP##C##1
region.
These
results
are
consistent
with
the
hypothesis
of
link##age
to
HP##C##1
in
a
subset
of
families
with
pro##state

particularly
those
with

We

the

(D##M)
lo##cus
to
twelve
of
these

as
studied
in
45
families
with

The
resulting
genetic
map
is
supported
by
the
local##isation
of
the
DNA
markers
in
a
panel
of
so##matic
cell
hybrid##s.
Ten
of
the
twelve
markers
have
been
shown
to
be
pro##ximal
to
the
D##M
gene
and
two,
PR##K##C##G
and
D##19##S##22,
di##stal
but
at
distances
of
approximately
25
c##M
and
15
c##M,
respectively.
The
closest
pro##ximal
markers
are
AP##OC##2
(a##poli##pop##rote##in
C-II)
and
C##K##M
(c##rea##tine
kinase,
muscle)
approximately
3
c##M
and
2
c##M
from
the
D##M
gene
respectively,
in
the
order
AP##OC##2-C##K##M-D##M.
The
distance
between
AP##OC##2,
C##K##M
and
D##M
(of
the
order
of
2
million
base
pairs)
and
their
known
orientation
should
permit
directional
chromosome
walking
and
jumping.
The
data
presented
here
should
enable
us
to
determine
whether
or
not
new
markers
are
di##stal
to
AP##OC##2/C##K##M
and
thus
potentially
flank
the

gene..

Our

We
h##y##pot##hes##ize
that
large

also
occur
in
the

and
that
a

E-ca##dh##eri##n
gene
(CD##H1)
mutations
pre##dis##pose
to
f##ami##lial
gas##tric
cancer
and
color##ec##tal
cancer.
In##her##ited
mutations
in
the
E-ca##dh##eri##n
gene
(CD##H1)
were
described
recently
in
three
Mao##ri
kind##red##s
with
f##ami##lial
gas##tric
cancer.
F##ami##lial
gas##tric
cancer
is
genetically
he##tero##gene##ous
and
it
is
not
clear
what
proportion
of
gas##tric
cancer
su##s##ce##pt##ibility
in
non-Mao##ri
populations
is
due
to
g##er##m##line
CD##H1
mutations.
Therefore,
we
screened
eight
f##ami##lial
gas##tric
cancer
kind##red##s
of
British
and
Irish
origin
for
g##er##m##line
CD##H1
mutations,
by
SS##CP
analysis
of
all
16
ex##ons
and
flank##ing
sequences.
Each
family
contained
(i)
two
cases
of
gas##tric
cancer
in
first
degree
relatives
with
one
affected
before
age
50
years;
or
(ii)
three
or
more
cases
of
gas##tric
cancer.
Novel
g##er##m##line
CD##H1
mutations
(a
nonsense
and
a
s##p##lice
site)
were
detected
in
two
families
(25%).
Both
mutations
were
predicted
to
t##run##cate
the
E-ca##dh##eri##n
protein
in
the
signal
p##eptide
domain.
In
one
family
there
was
evidence
of
non-pen##et##rance
and
su##s##ce##pt##ibility
to
both
gas##tric
and
color##ec##tal
cancer;
thus,
in
addition
to
six
cases
of
gas##tric
cancer,
a
CD##H1
mutation
carrier
developed
color##ec##tal
cancer
at
age
30
years.
We
have
confirmed
that
g##er##m##line
mutations
in
the
CD##H1
gene
cause
f##ami##lial
gas##tric
cancer
in
non-Mao##ri
populations.
However,
only
a
minority
of
f##ami##lial
gas##tric
cancer##s
can
be
accounted
for
by
CD##H1
mutations.
Loss
of
E-ca##dh##eri##n
function
has
been
implicated
in
the
path##ogen##esis
of
s##poradic
color##ec##tal
and
other
cancer##s,
and
our
findings
provide
evidence
that
g##er##m##line
CD##H1
mutations
pre##dis##pose
to
early
onset
color##ec##tal
cancer.
Thus,
CD##H1
should
be
investigated
as
a
cause
of
inherited
su##s##ce##pt##ibility
to
both
gas##tric
and
color##ec##tal
cancer##s.

We
have
identified
a

p##ed##ig##ree
where
the
disease
is
associated
with
a
molecular

have

These

show
that
this

has
transmitted
three
distinct
types
of

to
her
offspring.
This
observation
may
be
explained
by
post##ulating
that
the

arose
as
a

within
this

who
was

in

The

disorder
genes
are
known
to
map.
Our
findings
represent
the
only
case
in
which
the
molecular
basis
of
the
protein-import
deficiency
in
human
per##ox##is##oma##l
disorders
is
understood.
X-linked
spa##stic
para##ple##gia
and
P##eli##za##eus-Me##rz##bach##er
disease
are
all##eli##c
disorders
at
the
pro##te##oli##pid
protein
lo##cus.
Three
forms
of
X-linked
spa##stic
para##ple##gia
(SP##G)
have
been
defined.
One
lo##cus
(SP##G
1)
maps
to
X##q##28
while
two
clinical##ly
distinct
forms
map
to
X##q##22
(SP##G##2).
A
rare
X-linked
d##ys##my##elin##ating
disorder
of
the
central
nervous
system,
P##eli##za##eus-Me##rz##bach##er
disease
(PM##D),
has
also
been
mapped
to
X##q##21-q##22,
and
is
caused
by
mutations
in
the
pro##te##oli##pid
protein
gene
(P##LP)
which
en##codes
two
my##elin
proteins,
P##LP
and
D##M##20.
While
narrowing
the
genetic
interval
containing
SP##G##2
in
a
large
p##ed##ig##ree,
we
found
that
P##LP
was
the
closest
marker
to
the
disease
lo##cus,
imp##lica##ting
P##LP
as
a
possible
candidate
gene.
We
have
found
that
a
point
mutation
(His##13##9##T##yr)
in
ex##on
3##B
of
an
affected
male
produces
a
mutant
P##LP
but
a
normal
D##M##20,
and
se##g##re##gate##s
with
the
disease
(Z##max
=
6.
63,
the##ta
=
0.
00).
It
appears,
therefore,
that
SP##G##2
and
PM##D
are
all##eli##c
disorders
